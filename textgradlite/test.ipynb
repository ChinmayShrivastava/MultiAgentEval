      "Options A, C, and D do not align with the definition of a Type I error in this scenario. Option A mentions halting the production process based on customer complaints, which is not related to the specified tissue strength level. Option C describes halting the production process when the tissue strength is within specifications, which would not be an error. Option D suggests allowing the production process to continue when the tissue strength is below specifications, which would also not be an error.\n"
