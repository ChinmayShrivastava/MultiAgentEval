The frequency heard by the person is given by the Doppler effect formula: f' = f(v + vo) \/ (v + vs), where f is the original frequency, v is the speed of sound, vo is the speed of the observer, and vs is the speed of the source. Plugging in the values, we get f' = 1200(330 + 55) \/ (330 + 0) = 1300 Hz.","answer":"B"},false],["global_facts","As of 2014, about what percentage of primary aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa were out-of-school?","10%","20%","35%","50%",{"rationale":"produce the answer.
