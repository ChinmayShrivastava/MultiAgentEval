Genetic recombination during meiosis involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. This exchange is visually represented by the formation of chiasmata, which are visible points where crossing over has occurred. Therefore, the correct answer is option D.","answer":"D"},true],["global_facts","In 1948 how many Americans believed the Kinsey Report on Sexuality in the Male to be a bad thing?","92%","64%","27%","11%",{"rationale":"produce the answer.

The maximum possible order for an element of S_n is n, so for n = 7, the maximum possible order is 7.","answer":"A"},false],["logical_fallacies","When someone is aware of evidence that contradicts her claim, but doesn't consider that evidence when making her argument, she may have committed which of the following fallacies?","slippery slope","appeal to authority","appeal to pride","suppressed evidence",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We need to identify the fallacy where someone ignores contradictory evidence when making an argument.","answer":"D"},true],["high_school_statistics","Random samples of size n are drawn from a population. The mean of each sample is calculated, and the standard deviation of this set of sample means is found. Then the procedure is repeated, this time with samples of size 4n.

The standard deviation of the sample mean is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. Therefore, if the sample size is increased by a factor of 4 (from n to 4n), the standard deviation of the sample mean will be reduced by a factor of sqrt(4) = 2. Therefore, the standard deviation of the second group will be half as large as the standard deviation of the first group.","answer":"D"},true],["abstract_algebra","Find the maximum possible order for some element of Z_4 x Z_6.","4","6","12","24",{"rationale":"produce the answer.

Differentiation is the process by which denser materials sink to the core of a planet while lighter materials rise to the surface. This process is primarily driven by the minimization of gravitational potential energy, where denser materials move towards the center of the planet due to gravity.","answer":"B"},true],["astronomy","The reason that small planets tend to lose interior heat faster than larger planets is essentially the same as the reason that ________.","a large baked potato takes longer to cool than a small baked potato","Earth contains more metal than the Moon","thunderstorms tend to form on hot summer days","gas bubbles form and rise upward in boiling water",{"rationale":"produce the answer. The surface area-to-volume ratio is higher for smaller objects, which means they lose heat faster. This is similar to the concept of a large baked potato cooling slower than a small baked potato due to the difference in surface area-to-volume ratio.","answer":"A"},true],["high_school_mathematics","If f : (x, y) \u2192 (x + y, 2y \u2013 x) for every coordinate pair in the xy-plane, for what points (x, y) is it true that f : (x, y) \u2192 (x, y)?","(0, 0) only","The set of points (x, y) such that x = 0","The set of points (x, y) such that y = 0","The set of points (x, y) such that x = y",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We need to find the points (x, y) such that f(x, y) = (x, y). This means x + y = x and 2y - x = y. Simplifying these equations, we get y = 0 and x = 0. Therefore, the only point that satisfies both equations is (0, 0).","answer":"A"},true],["jurisprudence","Posner's economic analysis of law is roundly attacked by Dworkin who says the theory 'has not achieved the beginning of a beginning.'
