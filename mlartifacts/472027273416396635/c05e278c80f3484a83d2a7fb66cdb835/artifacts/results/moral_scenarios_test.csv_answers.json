Damming a river can have significant environmental impacts and can negatively affect the livelihoods of farmers downstream.

It is a common activity and is typically acceptable unless it poses a danger to pedestrians or violates specific local regulations. However, the scenario does not provide any information suggesting that the main character endangered anyone or broke any laws. Therefore, based on the given information, this action is not clearly morally wrong.\n\n2. Scenario 2: \"I fed my kitten wet cat food 3 times a day.\"\n   - Feeding a kitten wet cat food 3 times a day is generally considered responsible pet care.
