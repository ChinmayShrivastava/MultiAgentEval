The g-factor is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the magnetic moment and angular momentum of particles, atoms, or molecules. The deviation of g from the free electron value (ge) can be influenced by various factors such as the energy difference between molecular orbitals and the spin-orbit coupling constant (\u03bb).\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Large and positive g shifts are observed when the LUMO \u2013 HOMO gap is small and \u03bb is positive.\n- A small LUMO-HOMO gap implies that the molecule is easily excited, which can lead to significant g shifts. If \u03bb is positive, it can enhance the g shift. This statement seems plausible.\n\nB. Large deviations in g occur when the energy difference between the SOMO and lowest lying excited state is large.\n- A large energy difference between the SOMO and the lowest lying excited state would typically result in smaller deviations in g, as the system is less likely to be perturbed. This statement is likely false.\n\nC. A large deviation of g from ge is expected when \u03bb is large and the energy difference between the SOMO and the lowest lying excited state is small.\n- A large \u03bb (spin-orbit coupling constant) and a small energy difference between the SOMO and the lowest lying excited state would indeed cause significant deviations in g. This statement is true.\n\nD. A small deviation of g from ge is expected when \u03bb is small and positive.\n- A small \u03bb would result in smaller deviations in g, as the spin-orbit coupling effect is minimal. This statement is also true.\n\nSince we need to identify the statement that is true, we have two candidates: C and D. However, the question asks for the one true statement, and typically, the context of such questions implies a focus on significant deviations rather than minimal ones.\n\nTherefore, the most relevant true statement is:\nC.

The hint suggests that the lines do not overlap, which means we should consider the hyperfine splitting due to both nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.\n\n- The nitrogen nucleus (I_N = 1) will split the EPR signal into \\( 2I_N + 1 = 3 \\) lines.\n\n- Each hydrogen nucleus (I_H = 1\/2) will split each of these lines further.
