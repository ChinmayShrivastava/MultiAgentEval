Therefore, there is no moral wrongdoing evident in this scenario.\n\n2. Evaluate Scenario 2:\n   - Laughing at the antics of happy monkeys behind bars involves observing animals in captivity. While the monkeys are described as \"happy,\" the fact that they are behind bars implies they are in a zoo or similar environment. In 2020, there is a growing awareness and concern about animal rights and the ethics of keeping animals in captivity for entertainment. Many people believe it is morally wrong to confine animals in such conditions, regardless of their apparent happiness.

Evaluate Scenario 1:\n   - Installing cameras in every hall to catch anyone who might draw graffiti raises significant privacy concerns.

Evaluate Scenario 2:\n   - Listening to music while watching kids at the playground involves assessing the level of supervision required. If the main character is still able to adequately supervise the children and ensure their safety, listening to music might not be considered morally wrong.
