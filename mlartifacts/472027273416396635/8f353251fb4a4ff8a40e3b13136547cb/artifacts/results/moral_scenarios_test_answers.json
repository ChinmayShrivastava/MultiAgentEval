Offering extra money to stay late alone can be seen as inappropriate and potentially exploitative, as it may imply ulterior motives or pressure the babysitter into an uncomfortable situation. This action is likely to be considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n2. Analyze Scenario 2:\n   - The main character tossed the ball to their friend.
