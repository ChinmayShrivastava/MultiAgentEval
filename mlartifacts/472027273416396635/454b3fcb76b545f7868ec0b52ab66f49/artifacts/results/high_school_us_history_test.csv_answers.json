One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative.

This group would be most likely to support Douglass's perspective.\n\n","D","D"],["This question refers to the following information.\nOn Being Brought from Africa to America\n'Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,\nTaught my benighted soul to understand\nThat there's a God, that there's a Saviour too;\nOnce I redemption neither sought nor knew.\nSome view our sable race with scornful eye,\n\"Their colour is a diabolic die.\"\nRemember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,\nMay be refin'd, and join th' angelic train.\n\u2014Phillis Wheatley, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, 1773\nThe point of Wheatley's poem can best be compared to which of the following?","Task Statement:\n\nDetermine the point of Wheatley's poem and compare it to a given list of options.\nKey Details:\n\n- Poem Title: \"On Being Brought from Africa to America\"\n- Author: Phillis Wheatley\n- Publication: Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, 1773\n- Key Themes:\n  - Mercy and redemption\n  - Understanding of God and Saviour\n  - Racial prejudice (\"sable race\" and \"diabolic die\")\n  - Equality in spiritual refinement (\"Negroes, black as Cain, may be refin'd\")\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNot applicable (literary analysis)\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

They established a weak central government with limited powers, as the states retained most of their sovereignty and independence.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Excerpt**: The provided excerpt from the Journals of the Continental Congress emphasizes the difficulty of combining various sentiments and interests of many sovereign and independent communities. It also highlights the necessity of uniting all councils and strength to maintain and defend common liberties.\n\n3. **Challenges Mentioned**: The excerpt points to the challenges of uniting diverse states and interests under a single system. This suggests that the Articles of Confederation struggled with creating a cohesive and effective central authority.\n\n4. **Identifying the Major Weakness**: Given the context and the challenges mentioned in the excerpt, we need to identify which of the provided options aligns with the described difficulties.\n\n   - **Option A**: Created a too-powerful chief executive. This is incorrect because the Articles of Confederation did not create a strong executive branch; in fact, they lacked a chief executive entirely.\n   \n   - **Option B**: Did not include a mechanism for their own amendment. This is incorrect because the Articles did include a mechanism for amendment, though it required unanimous consent from all states, making it very difficult but not impossible.\n   \n   - **Option C**: Made it too difficult for the government to raise money through taxes and duties. This is a significant weakness of the Articles of Confederation. The central government had no power to levy taxes directly and had to request funds from the states, which often did not comply.\n   \n   - **Option D**: Denied the federal government the power to mediate disputes between states. While this was a problem, it is not the primary weakness highlighted by the excerpt, which focuses more on the difficulty of uniting the states and maintaining common liberties.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The major weakness of the Articles of Confederation, as highlighted by the excerpt, is the difficulty in uniting the states and effectively governing them, which is closely related to the inability to raise money through taxes and duties. This financial weakness severely limited the central government's ability to function effectively.\n\n","C","C"],["This question refers to the following information.\n\"An act for the more effectual protection of the property of married women:\n\"\u00a71.

Together we will meet these threats to peace.\u2026\nThree basic developments have helped to shape our challenges: the steady growth and increased projection of Soviet military power beyond its own borders; the overwhelming dependence of the Western democracies on oil supplies from the Middle East; and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nations of the developing world, exemplified by the revolution in Iran.\nEach of these factors is important in its own right.

This event occurred after the establishment of the Second Bank of the United States and thus could not have caused its formation.\n\n2. **Option B: Unregulated currency and federal debts after the War of 1812** - The War of 1812 caused significant financial strain on the United States, leading to unregulated currency and mounting federal debts. This financial instability highlighted the need for a centralized banking system to stabilize the economy, which directly led to the formation of the Second Bank of the United States in 1816.\n\n3. **Option C: Efforts by Alexander Hamilton to stabilize the national economy** - Alexander Hamilton's efforts were instrumental in the creation of the First Bank of the United States in 1791, not the Second Bank. His influence was significant in the early financial system of the U.S., but it does not directly relate to the formation of the Second Bank.\n\n4. **Option D: Federalist counter-reaction to the extreme budget-cutting under Jefferson** - While political reactions to budget policies under Jefferson might have influenced economic decisions, they were not the direct cause of the formation of the Second Bank.

His primary focus was on maintaining the Union rather than immediately addressing the issue of emancipation.\n   - The Emancipation Proclamation was not issued until January 1, 1863, indicating that Lincoln's stance on slavery was more cautious in the early years of his presidency.\n\n3. **Radical Republicans' Political Stance and Goals**:\n   - The Radical Republicans wanted immediate emancipation of slaves and were critical of any measures that did not align with this goal.\n   - They were also concerned with ensuring that freed slaves would have civil rights and suffrage.\n\n4. **Comparison of Lincoln's Policies and Actions with Radical Republicans' Expectations**:\n   - Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan, proposed in 1863, was seen as too lenient by the Radical Republicans. It allowed for the reintegration of Southern states into the Union if 10% of their voters swore an oath of allegiance, but it did not address black suffrage.\n   - The Radical Republicans wanted more stringent requirements for Southern states' readmission and guarantees of rights for freed slaves.\n\n5. **Key Reasons for Opposition**:\n   - The Radical Republicans' opposition in 1861 would likely stem from Lincoln's cautious approach to emancipation and his initial focus on preserving the Union rather than addressing slavery immediately.\n\nGiven these points, the best explanation for why Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln in 1861 is that they wanted immediate emancipation of slaves, but Lincoln refused to cooperate with this goal.\n\n","B","B"],["This question refers to the following information.\nI appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not meat: if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not?

The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'\"\nMary Ann Glendon, \"The Forgotten Crucible: The Latin American Influence on the Universal Human Rights Idea,\u201d 2003\nWhich of the following presidents was most involved in Latin American politics in the twentieth century?","Template:\n\nTask Statement:\n\nIdentify the president most involved in Latin American politics in the twentieth century.\nKey Details:\n\n- The question pertains to the involvement of a president in Latin American politics during the twentieth century.\n- The provided excerpts discuss historical perspectives on slavery, natural rights, and the influence of Latin American thought on human rights but do not directly mention any presidents or their involvement in Latin American politics.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone (This is a historical\/political analysis question, not a mathematical one.)\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

We need to compare these themes with contemporary nineteenth-century American political movements:\n\n   - **Manifest Destiny**: This movement was characterized by the belief in the inevitable expansion of the United States across the North American continent. It involved a sense of mission and destiny, often romanticized, and required leadership to unite diverse groups in the pursuit of expansion.\n   - **Southern secessionism**: This movement focused on the Southern states' desire to secede from the Union, primarily to preserve the institution of slavery. It was more about division than unity.\n   - **Abolitionism**: This movement aimed to end slavery and was driven by moral and humanitarian concerns. While it involved leadership and a sense of mission, it did not focus on romantic enterprise or uniting diverse groups for conquest.\n   - **Know-Nothingism**: This was an anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic movement. It was characterized by nativism and xenophobia, not by romantic enterprise or uniting diverse groups.\n\n4.

The prominence of conservatism during this period was more closely associated with the Republican Party and figures like Ronald Reagan, rather than the Libertarian party.\n\n2. **Option B: the growth of religious fundamentalism**\n   - The growth of religious fundamentalism, particularly the rise of the Moral Majority and other evangelical Christian groups, played a significant role in the conservative movement. These groups supported conservative policies and candidates, contributing to the prominence of conservatism.\n\n3. **Option C: perceived economic and foreign policy failures under President Carter**\n   - The economic difficulties (such as stagflation) and perceived foreign policy failures (such as the Iran hostage crisis) during President Carter's administration contributed to the rise of conservatism. These issues led many voters to seek alternative leadership, which they found in conservative candidates like Ronald Reagan.\n\n4. **Option D: social changes following the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War**\n   - Social changes following the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War led to a backlash among some segments of the population, who felt that traditional values were being undermined.
