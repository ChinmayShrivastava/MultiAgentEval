This structural assumption has a significant impact on the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.\n\n3. **Option C: Whether we have equal class priors or priors estimated from the data**\n   - This option affects the prior probabilities of the classes.

This typically increases the bias (error due to the model being too simple) and decreases the variance (since the model is less sensitive to fluctuations in the training data).\n\nTherefore, setting the bias parameters to 0 would increase the model's bias and decrease the model's variance, which is the opposite of what Statement 2 claims.\n\nThus, Statement 2 is false.\n\nCombining the results:\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is false.\n\n","C","C"]]}
