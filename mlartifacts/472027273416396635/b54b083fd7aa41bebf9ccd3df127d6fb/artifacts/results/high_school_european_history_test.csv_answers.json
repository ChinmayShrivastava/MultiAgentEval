He is not relying on ancient textual authority, experimentation, or purely deductive reasoning from abstract principles.

This option seems highly relevant as it directly impacts food availability.\n\n3. **Option C: The creation of a strong putting-out system that allowed people to be paid for their work**\n   - The putting-out system involved subcontracting work to people who completed tasks at home.

It might alleviate some economic hardships but would not solve the fundamental problem of food scarcity.\n\n4. **Option D: A declining population during the seventeenth century that led to better food yields and less hunger as Europe urbanized**\n   - A declining population could lead to less competition for food resources, potentially reducing hunger. However, the report describes a situation where people are already dying in large numbers, suggesting that population decline alone would not be sufficient to resolve the hunger crisis. Additionally, urbanization often leads to increased demand for food in cities, which could exacerbate the problem.\n\nGiven the context and the nature of the problem described in the report, the most responsible factor for ending the problems of hunger would likely be improvements in agricultural practices, as these would directly increase food production and availability.\n\n","B","B"],["This question refers to the following information.\n\"But you, my dear Pangloss,\" said Candide, \"how can it be that I behold you again?\"\n\"It is true,\" said Pangloss, \"that you saw me hanged&\u2026.A surgeon purchased my body, carried home, and dissected me.

In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance.

Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit.

This created a court culture of extravagance and dependency, which could be seen as a significant flaw in his governance.","To determine the greatest weakness and regret of King Louis XIV's rule based on the provided memoir excerpt, we need to analyze the key details and implications of his policies and behavior.\n\n1. **Louis XIV's Expectations and Behavior**:\n   - He expected continual attendance at Court from all persons of distinction and noticed the absence of even those of inferior degree.\n   - He required explanations for absences and was displeased with those who seldom appeared.\n   - He enhanced the value of favors by his manner of bestowing them.\n   - He loved splendor, magnificence, and encouraged similar tastes in his Court.\n   - He compelled courtiers to live beyond their income, making them dependent on his bounty.\n\n2. **Implications of His Policies**:\n   - His insistence on continual attendance and explanations for absences created a culture of constant surveillance and control.\n   - By encouraging extravagant spending, he made courtiers financially dependent on him, reducing their autonomy.\n   - This dependency could lead to a lack of genuine loyalty and support, as courtiers were bound by financial necessity rather than true allegiance.\n\n3. **Negative Aspects of His Rule**:\n   - The culture of extravagance and dependency could be seen as a significant flaw, as it undermined the stability and independence of the nobility.\n   - His focus on ceremonies and appearances might have detracted from effective governance.\n   - The memoir does not directly address his military campaigns or administrative delegation, so these aspects are less relevant to the provided text.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The greatest weakness and regret, as inferred from the memoir, is likely related to the culture of extravagance and dependency he fostered among his courtiers. This aligns most closely with the idea that his domination of the nobility left him without genuine friends and allies, as their loyalty was financially motivated rather than sincere.\n\n","A","D"],["This question refers to the following information.\n\"The Government of the German Reich and The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics desirous of strengthening the cause of peace between Germany and the U.S.S.R., and proceeding from the fundamental provisions of the Neutrality Agreement concluded in April, 1926 between Germany and the U.S.S.R., have reached the following Agreement:\nArticle I.

Their protests played a significant role in bringing attention to the mistreatment of indigenous people and led to reforms such as the New Laws of 1542.\n   - Conclusion: This option contributed to ending the encomienda system.\n\n2. **Option B: The lack of new land to assign to well-connected Spaniards and conquistadores**\n   - Historical Context: As colonization progressed, the availability of new land decreased, making it difficult to continue the encomienda system. This lack of new land reduced the incentive to maintain the system.\n   - Conclusion: This option contributed to ending the encomienda system.\n\n3. **Option C: The Spanish royal crown's desire to control the estates more directly**\n   - Historical Context: The Spanish crown sought to centralize power and control over the colonies, which included reducing the power of encomenderos (holders of encomiendas).

Poor transportation could exacerbate these issues by making it harder to distribute relief and food supplies. Thus, poor transportation likely contributed to the problems.\n\nGiven the context of the report, the factor that contributed the least to the health and hunger problems faced by the French people in the seventeenth century is \"Low taxes on the peasants and middle class,\" as it is not mentioned and would not logically contribute to the described suffering.\n\n","C","C"],["This question refers to the following information.\nRead the the following poem to answer questions.\nTake up the White Man's burden\u2014\nSend forth the best ye breed\u2014\nGo bind your sons to exile\nTo serve your captives' need;\nTo wait in heavy harness,\nOn fluttered folk and wild\u2014\nYour new-caught, sullen peoples,\nHalf-devil and half-child.\n...\nTake up the White Man's burden\u2014\nThe savage wars of peace\u2014\nFill full the mouth of Famine\nAnd bid the sickness cease;\nAnd when your goal is nearest\nThe end for others sought\u2026\nWatch sloth and heathen Folly\nBring all your hopes to naught.\nRudyard Kipling, The White Man's Burden, 1899\nIt is generally acknowledged that Kipling fashioned White Man's Burden to address the subject of the American colonization of the Philippines, which the United States had recently won from Spain in the Spanish-American War.

While Paine's work is a pamphlet, the core ideas he expresses are more about Reason and individual rights.\n   - **Option C:** This option suggests that most Enlightenment intellectuals rejected religion altogether and adopted atheism. Paine does not reject religion entirely; he believes in one God and moral duties, but rejects institutionalized religion.\n   - **Option D:** This option suggests that Enlightenment intellectuals believed scientific discoveries would solve all problems. Paine's focus is more on Reason and individual rights rather than scientific discoveries.\n\nBased on the analysis, the characteristic best illustrated by Paine's ideas is the use of new methods of communicating their ideas, such as salons and inexpensive printed pamphlets, as his work itself is a pamphlet.\n\n","B","B"],["This question refers to the following information.\n\"The substitution of Plato for the scholastic Aristotle was hastened by contact with Byzantine scholarship.

He states that the society is \"ripe for change\" and has \"long been yearning for it,\" implying that the need for perestroika has been present for a considerable time.\n4. Gorbachev warns that any delay in beginning perestroika could lead to serious crises, reinforcing the idea that the need for change has been building up over time and is now at a critical point.\n\nBased on these points, it is clear that Gorbachev argues that the need for perestroika was not sudden but had been developing over a long period. Therefore, the correct inference is that the need for perestroika was long in the making.\n\n","C","C"],["This question refers to the following information.\n\"A specter is haunting Europe-the specter of Communism.

Option A mentions \"A series of revolutions that gripped Europe in the same year.\" This refers to the widespread revolutionary movements across Europe in 1848, known as the Revolutions of 1848 or the Springtime of Nations. These revolutions were driven by demands for political reform, national independence, and social change, which aligns with the context of the manifesto addressing the rise of Communism.\n4. Option B mentions \"The Ottoman Empire's increasing pressure upon the Greek Peninsula.\" This event does not specifically coincide with the year 1848 and is less relevant to the context of the manifesto.\n5. Option C mentions \"A new system of underground pamphlet distribution.\" While pamphlet distribution was a method used by revolutionaries, it is not a specific historical event that coincided with the publication of the manifesto.\n6.
