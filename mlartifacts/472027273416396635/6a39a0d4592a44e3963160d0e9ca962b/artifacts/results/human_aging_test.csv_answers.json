Omega-3 fatty acids are believed to have neuroprotective properties that can help maintain cognitive function.\n\nC.

This extended duration can lead to a stronger attachment due to familiarity and routine.\n\n2. **Emotional and Social Connections**: Over time, older adults may have developed deeper emotional and social connections within their community. These connections can include friendships, family ties, and participation in local activities, all of which contribute to a stronger sense of belonging and attachment.\n\n3. **Life Experiences and Memories**: Older adults have accumulated more life experiences and memories associated with a place.

Their role in enhancing cellular health and longevity supports this option.\n\n2. **Ward off dementias**: Sirtuins have been studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. There is evidence suggesting that sirtuins may help protect against cognitive decline and neurodegeneration, which could be interpreted as warding off dementias.\n\n3. **Increase memory and intelligence**: While sirtuins may have some impact on brain health, there is less direct evidence to suggest that they specifically increase memory and intelligence. The primary focus of sirtuin research is more on disease prevention and longevity rather than cognitive enhancement.\n\n4. **Produce emotional stability**: There is limited evidence to suggest that sirtuins directly influence emotional stability.

This is a major reason for the increase in the number of older adults.\n\n2. **The steadily increasing birth rate (Option B)**:\n   - An increasing birth rate would lead to a larger younger population rather than an older one. Historically, birth rates in many developed countries have been declining, not increasing. Therefore, this option does not align with the common reasons for an increase in the number of older adults.\n\n3. **Increases in life expectancy at birth (Option C)**:\n   - Improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions have led to increases in life expectancy at birth, meaning more people are living longer and reaching older ages. This is a major reason for the increase in the number of older adults.\n\n4. **Increases in life expectancy at a specified age (Option D)**:\n   - Similar to life expectancy at birth, increases in life expectancy at a specified age (e.g., 65 years) mean that people are living longer once they reach older adulthood.

It involves a specific requirement that older workers no longer need to prove.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Discrimination - This is too broad. Proving discrimination is generally the core of any discrimination suit, so it is unlikely that this is what older workers no longer need to prove.\n\nB. Age bias - This is specific to older workers and directly related to job discrimination based on age. It is plausible that the Supreme Court ruling could have changed the requirement for proving age bias.\n\nC. Negative impact - This is a general term and not specific to age or job discrimination. It is less likely to be the specific requirement in question.\n\nD. Intention - Proving intention can be a significant burden in discrimination cases. It is possible that the Supreme Court ruling has removed the need to prove intentional discrimination.\n\nGiven the context of job discrimination suits and the focus on older workers, the most likely specific requirement that older workers no longer need to prove is \"intention\" (D).
