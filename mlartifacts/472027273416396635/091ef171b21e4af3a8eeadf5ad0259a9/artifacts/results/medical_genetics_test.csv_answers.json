Hurler's Syndrome**: This is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans. It does not directly impact ammonia levels.\n   - **C. Ornithine Transcarbamylase (OTC) Deficiency**: This is a genetic disorder affecting the urea cycle. OTC is an enzyme critical for converting ammonia into urea. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to the accumulation of ammonia in the blood.\n   - **D. Phenylketonuria**: This is a metabolic disorder affecting the breakdown of the amino acid phenylalanine. It does not directly impact the urea cycle or ammonia levels.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the condition that directly affects the urea cycle and leads to high blood ammonia levels is ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency.\n\n","C","C"],["In genome-wide association studies, known SNPs explain ______ of the variation in body mass index despite the evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies.","Task Statement:\n\nDetermine the percentage of variation in body mass index (BMI) explained by known SNPs in genome-wide association studies.\n\nKey Details:\n\n- Known SNPs\n- Variation in body mass index (BMI)\n- Evidence of greater than 50% heritability from twin and family studies\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone (the task is to identify a specific percentage, not to perform a calculation)\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1. Identify the percentage of variation in BMI explained by known SNPs from genome-wide association studies.\n2. Compare this percentage to the heritability estimate from twin and family studies (greater than 50%).\n\nMissing Data:\n\n- The exact percentage of variation in BMI explained by known SNPs is not provided in the question. This data is essential to complete the task.","To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the percentage of variation in body mass index (BMI) explained by known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The question provides a context that known SNPs explain a small fraction of the variation in BMI, despite twin and family studies indicating a heritability of greater than 50%.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n- Option A: only 5%\n- Option B: less than 1%\n- Option C: only 13%\n- Option D: less than 2%\n\nGiven the context, we know that the percentage explained by known SNPs is significantly lower than the heritability estimate from twin and family studies. This suggests that the correct answer should be a small percentage.\n\nOption A (only 5%) and Option C (only 13%) are relatively higher percentages compared to the expected small fraction. Therefore, these options are less likely to be correct.\n\nOption B (less than 1%) and Option D (less than 2%) are both very small percentages, which align with the context provided. However, \"less than 1%\" is a more precise and smaller fraction compared to \"less than 2%.\"\n\nBased on this reasoning, the most accurate answer is likely to be Option B (less than 1%).\n\n","B","D"],["Differential distribution of substances in the egg most typically results in:","Task Statement:\n\nDetermine the result of the differential distribution of substances in an egg.\n\nKey Details:\n\n- Differential distribution refers to the uneven allocation of substances within the egg.\n- This process is crucial during the early stages of embryonic development.\n- It influences the formation of different cell types and tissues.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\n- Not applicable (conceptual understanding required).\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

Differential distribution of substances in the egg refers to the uneven allocation of materials such as proteins and mRNA within the egg.\n2. This uneven distribution is crucial during the early stages of embryonic development as it leads to varying concentrations of these substances in different regions of the embryo.\n3. These variations in concentration are essential for cell differentiation, which is the process by which cells become specialized in structure and function.\n4. The differential distribution of substances influences gene expression in different regions of the embryo, leading to the establishment of distinct patterns and the formation of different cell types and tissues.\n5. Therefore, the most appropriate result of the differential distribution of substances in the egg is differences in gene expression which may establish a pattern in the embryo as the cells divide.\n\n","A","A"],["Which of the following conditions is not caused by a mutation in FGFR3?","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify which condition is not caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene.\nKey Details:\n\n- FGFR3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3) is a gene associated with various conditions.\n- Conditions commonly caused by mutations in FGFR3 include:\n  - Achondroplasia\n  - Hypochondroplasia\n  - Thanatophoric dysplasia\n  - Muenke syndrome\n- The task is to determine which condition listed is not linked to FGFR3 mutations.\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone (this is a knowledge-based question).\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.
