This broadening effectively averages out any coupling interactions with the proton, resulting in a singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nGiven these points, the correct explanation for why the 1H spectrum of 12CHCl3 is a singlet is that both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments, which prevent the observation of coupling with the proton.\n\n","D","D"],["At 25\u00b0C, the maximum amount of PbI2 that can be dissolved in 1.00 L of pure water is 1.0 mmol.

This is typically evaluated using the Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G).\n\n2. **Gibbs Free Energy**: For a process to be spontaneous, the Gibbs free energy change must be negative (\u0394G < 0). The formula for Gibbs free energy change is:\n   \\[\n   \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S\n   \\]\n   where \u0394H is the change in enthalpy, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and \u0394S is the change in entropy.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: \"The process is exothermic.\" This implies \u0394H < 0. While many spontaneous processes are exothermic, not all are. Some spontaneous processes can be endothermic if the entropy increase (\u0394S) is sufficiently large to make \u0394G negative.\n   - **Option B**: \"The process does not involve any work.\" This is not necessarily true. Spontaneous processes can involve work; the key factor is the overall Gibbs free energy change.\n   - **Option C**: \"The entropy of the system increases.\" This implies \u0394S > 0 for the system. However, the entropy of the system alone does not determine spontaneity. The total entropy change of the system and surroundings must be considered.\n   - **Option D**: \"The total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.\" According to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy of the universe (system plus surroundings) increases for a spontaneous process. This aligns with the condition \u0394G < 0, which ensures that the total entropy change is positive.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The statement that is always true for a spontaneous process is that the total entropy of the system plus surroundings increases.

This means that the exchange interaction (J) is much greater than the hyperfine coupling constant (a), leading to a strong coupling between the two unpaired electrons. In this case, the EPR spectrum will be dominated by the exchange interaction, and the hyperfine splitting will be less significant.\n\nFor a diradical with strong exchange interaction, the number of lines is determined by the coupling of the two unpaired electrons to the two nitrogen nuclei. Each nitrogen nucleus (I = 1) can split the EPR signal into 3 lines (2I + 1). Since there are two nitrogen nuclei, the total number of lines will be:\n\n- Number of lines = \\( 2I + 1 = 3 \\) lines for each nitrogen nucleus.\n- For two nitrogen nuclei, the total number of lines is \\( 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n\nHowever, due to the strong exchange interaction (J >> a), the actual number of lines observed will be fewer because the exchange interaction will dominate and simplify the spectrum. The correct number of lines in this case is typically 5, as the exchange interaction causes the lines to merge.\n\n","B","D"],["Redox enzyme catalysis involves the cyclic oxidation and reduction of metal ions that have at least two stable positive oxidation states.
