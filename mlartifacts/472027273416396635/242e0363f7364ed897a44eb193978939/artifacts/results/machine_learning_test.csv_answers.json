This means that among all linear unbiased estimators, the OLS estimator has the smallest variance.\n   - However, the statement claims that the linear regression estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators, not just linear ones. This is a broader claim and is not necessarily true because there could be non-linear unbiased estimators with smaller variance.\n   - Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.\n\n2. **Statement 2: The coefficients \u03b1 assigned to the classifiers assembled by AdaBoost are always non-negative.**\n   - The coefficient \u03b1 in AdaBoost is calculated as \u03b1 = 0.5 * ln((1 - \u03b5) \/ \u03b5), where \u03b5 is the weighted error rate of the classifier.\n   - Since \u03b5 ranges between 0 and 1, the term (1 - \u03b5) \/ \u03b5 is always greater than 0. When \u03b5 < 0.5, (1 - \u03b5) \/ \u03b5 > 1, making ln((1 - \u03b5) \/ \u03b5) positive. When \u03b5 = 0.5, ln((1 - \u03b5) \/ \u03b5) = ln(1) = 0. When \u03b5 > 0.5, (1 - \u03b5) \/ \u03b5 < 1, making ln((1 - \u03b5) \/ \u03b5) negative.\n   - Therefore, \u03b1 can be negative if \u03b5 > 0.5.\n   - Hence, Statement 2 is **False**.\n\nBased on the evaluation, both statements are false.\n\n","B","D"],["Statement 1| RoBERTa pretrains on a corpus that is approximate 10x larger than the corpus BERT pretrained on.

It works by generating multiple versions of a predictor and using these to get an aggregated predictor. The key steps in bagging include:\n\n1. Generating multiple datasets by sampling with replacement from the original dataset.\n2. Training a model on each of these datasets.\n3. Aggregating the predictions from all models (e.g., by averaging for regression or voting for classification).\n\nTo prevent overfitting, bagging relies on the following principles:\n- **Sampling with replacement**: This creates diverse datasets, which helps in reducing the variance of the model.\n- **Weak classifiers**: Using simple models (weak classifiers) ensures that each model does not overfit the data.\n- **Aggregation**: Combining the predictions of multiple models helps in smoothing out the noise and reducing overfitting.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **The use of sampling with replacement as the sampling technique**: This is a fundamental aspect of bagging that ensures diversity among the datasets, which helps in reducing overfitting.\n\nB. **The use of weak classifiers**: Weak classifiers are less likely to overfit individually, and their aggregated predictions tend to generalize better.\n\nC. **The use of classification algorithms which are not prone to overfitting**: While this can help, it is not specific to bagging. Bagging itself is designed to work with models that might overfit individually.\n\nD. **The practice of validation performed on every classifier trained**: Validation is important for model selection and tuning, but it is not a core mechanism of bagging to prevent overfitting.\n\nAmong these options, the one that directly relates to the mechanism of bagging to prevent overfitting is the use of sampling with replacement.\n\n","A","B"],["Statement 1| PCA and Spectral Clustering (such as Andrew Ng\u2019s) perform eigendecomposition on two different matrices.

Conclude which structural assumption most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.\nMissing Data:\n\nNone (all necessary information is provided or can be inferred).","To determine which structural assumption most affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting in a Gaussian Bayes classifier, we need to analyze each option:\n\nA. Whether we learn the class centers by Maximum Likelihood or Gradient Descent:\n- This affects the optimization method used to find the parameters but does not fundamentally change the model's complexity or its assumptions about the data distribution.\n\nB. Whether we assume full class covariance matrices or diagonal class covariance matrices:\n- Assuming full class covariance matrices allows the model to capture correlations between features, making it more flexible and potentially more complex. This can lead to overfitting if the model becomes too complex. On the other hand, assuming diagonal class covariance matrices simplifies the model by ignoring feature correlations, which can lead to underfitting if the true data distribution has significant correlations. This assumption directly impacts the model's complexity and its ability to generalize.\n\nC. Whether we have equal class priors or priors estimated from the data:\n- This affects the prior probabilities of the classes but does not significantly change the model's complexity or its assumptions about the feature distributions.\n\nD. Whether we allow classes to have different mean vectors or we force them to share the same mean vector:\n- Forcing classes to share the same mean vector would be an unrealistic assumption in most cases and would likely lead to severe underfitting. Allowing different mean vectors is a more reasonable assumption and does not significantly increase the model's complexity compared to the impact of covariance assumptions.\n\nGiven these analyses, the assumption about the covariance matrices (option B) most significantly affects the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting because it directly influences the model's ability to capture feature correlations and thus its complexity.\n\n","B","B"],["Statement 1| For any two variables x and y having joint distribution p(x, y), we always have H[x, y] \u2265 H[x] + H[y] where H is entropy function.

Batch Normalization normalizes the activations to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, but it does not guarantee a standard Gaussian distribution. The activations are then scaled and shifted by learnable parameters (gamma and beta), so the final distribution can vary.\n\nB. The bias parameter of affine layers becomes redundant if a batch normalization layer follows immediately afterward.\n- This is correct. Batch Normalization normalizes the output of the affine layer, which effectively cancels out the effect of the bias term. The subsequent scaling and shifting by gamma and beta parameters make the bias term redundant.\n\nC.
