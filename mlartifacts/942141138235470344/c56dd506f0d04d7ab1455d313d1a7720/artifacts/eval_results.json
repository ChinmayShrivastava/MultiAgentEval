We know that the charge \\( Q \\) on a capacitor is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ Q = C \\times V \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the capacitance and \\( V \\) is the potential difference. Given that the capacitance \\( C \\) is 2 mF (which is \\( 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\) F) and the potential difference \\( V \\) is 5 V, we can calculate the charge \\( Q \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ Q = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{F} \\times 5 \\, \\text{V} \\]\n\\[ Q = 10 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\\[ Q = 0.01 \\, \\text{C} \\]\n\nTherefore, the charge on the positive plate of the capacitor is 0.01 C.","B","B"],["Which of these quantities decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields?","What quantity decreases as the inverse square of distance?","The list of atomic information available in the question.\n- The question is about quantities that decrease as the inverse square of distance.\n- The context is for distances far from the objects producing the fields.","produce the answer. We need to identify which of the given fields decreases as the inverse square of the distance from the source. \n\n1. The electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod: For a finite-length charged rod, at distances far from the rod, the electric field behaves similarly to that of a point charge, which decreases as the inverse square of the distance.\n\n2. The electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder: For an infinitely long charged cylinder, the electric field decreases as the inverse of the distance, not the inverse square.\n\n3. The electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge: For an infinite plane of charge, the electric field is constant and does not decrease with distance.\n\n4. The magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire: For an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire, the magnetic field decreases as the inverse of the distance, not the inverse square.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod, which decreases as the inverse square of the distance.","A","A"],["A solid, metal object is isolated from other charges and has charge distributed on its surface. The charge distribution is not uniform. It may be correctly concluded that the","What can be concluded from a non-uniform charge distribution on an isolated metal object?","The list of atomic information available in the question.\n- The object is solid.\n- The object is made of metal.\n- The object is isolated from other charges.\n- The charge is distributed on the surface of the object.\n- The charge distribution is not uniform.","produce the answer. We know that for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor is zero. The charge resides on the surface, and the electric field just outside the surface of a conductor is perpendicular to the surface and proportional to the surface charge density. Given that the charge distribution is not uniform, the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, will vary according to the surface charge density at any location. The correct statement is that the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space.","D","D"],["Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length.

We know that the speed of a wave on a string is given by the equation \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} \\), where \\( T \\) is the tension in the string and \\( \\mu \\) is the linear mass density of the string. When the tension in the string is increased, the wave speed increases. The wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) of the standing wave is related to the wave speed \\( v \\) and the frequency \\( f \\) by the equation \\( v = f \\lambda \\). Since the frequency \\( f \\) is constant (100 Hz), an increase in wave speed \\( v \\) will result in an increase in the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\). Therefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be greater than the wavelength of the original standing waves.","C","C"],["Two identical capacitors are hooked in parallel to an external circuit.

We know that when capacitors are connected in parallel, they share the same voltage across them because they are connected to the same two points in the circuit. Since the capacitors are identical, their capacitance is also the same. However, the charge stored on each capacitor can be different depending on the voltage and capacitance. Therefore, the quantities that must be the same for both capacitors are the voltage across the capacitor and the capacitance of the capacitor.","C","D"],["A 1-kg object is released from rest at the top of a rough-surfaced incline.

We know that when an object slides down a rough incline, some of its gravitational potential energy is converted into thermal energy due to friction, and the rest is converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, the object's kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline will be less than its initial gravitational potential energy because some energy is lost to friction. The correct statement is that the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.","C","C"],["A student is experimenting with a simple spring-block oscillator of spring constant k and amplitude A.

When a small block is placed on top of the original block in a spring-block oscillator, the system's dynamics change. The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum acceleration, which occurs at the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. The force that keeps the small block from sliding off is the static friction force, which must be greater than the maximum horizontal force exerted by the spring. The maximum horizontal force is given by \\( kA \\), where \\( k \\) is the spring constant and \\( A \\) is the amplitude. The static friction force is given by \\( \\mu_s (M+m)g \\), where \\( \\mu_s \\) is the coefficient of static friction, \\( M \\) is the mass of the original block, \\( m \\) is the mass of the small block, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the small block will not slide off as long as \\( \\mu_s (M+m)g \\geq kA \\), which simplifies to \\( \\mu_s \\geq \\frac{kA}{(M+m)g} \\).","A","A"],["How much work is required to charge a 10 \u00b5F capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?","What is the work required to charge a capacitor?","The list of atomic information available in the question.\n- The capacitance of the capacitor is 10 \u00b5F.\n- The potential difference is 100 V.\n- The question asks for the work required to charge the capacitor.","produce the answer.

We start by considering the forces acting on the box. The only horizontal force is the kinetic friction force, which is given by \\( F_{\\text{friction}} = \\mu mg \\).
