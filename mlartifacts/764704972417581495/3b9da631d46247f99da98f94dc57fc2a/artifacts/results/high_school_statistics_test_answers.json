In this case, since the alternative hypothesis is HA: p > 0.3, we are conducting a one-tailed test. To find the P-value, we need to calculate the probability of observing a sample proportion greater than or equal to 0.35 when the true population proportion is 0.3.

The variance for tuition is 0 (as the cost is constant for all students) and the variances for books, room and board, and personal expenditure are ($65)^2, ($380)^2, and ($125)^2 respectively. Adding these variances together and then taking the square root gives us a total standard deviation of $190.\n","C","D"],["Self-efficacy (the belief that one has control over one's situation) as it related to job satisfaction was studied.

Therefore, we cannot infer causal relationships such as giving more control over the situation to make teachers happy or making teachers happier to take more control. Additionally, the correlation of 0.30 does not indicate the direction of the relationship, so we cannot conclude that more satisfaction leads to less confidence in control.
