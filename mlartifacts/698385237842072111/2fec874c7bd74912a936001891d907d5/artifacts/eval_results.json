We can use the formula for electric field strength due to a point charge, E = k * (q\/r^2), where k is the Coulomb's constant, q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge. Since the point is midway between the charges, the distance from each charge is 1.0 cm. We can calculate the electric field strength due to each charge and then add them together to find the total electric field strength at the point.","('B', 'C')","A. 0 N\/C\nB. 4.0 \u00d7 10^6 N\/C\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We can use the formula for electric field strength due to a dipole, which is E = (1\/4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080) * (2p\/r^3), where p is the dipole moment and r is the distance from the center of the dipole. Plugging in the given values, we can calculate the electric field strength at the midpoint.","B"]]}
