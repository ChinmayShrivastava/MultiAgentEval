It is isolated from other charges\n3. The charge distribution on its surface is not uniform","produce the toptwooptions. We know that for a metal object, the electric field inside the object is zero. This means that option B is not likely. The charge distribution being non-uniform means that the electric field outside the object will not be zero, so option A is also not likely. This leaves us with options C and D, and since the electric field outside the object is directly related to the surface charge density, option D is the most likely choice.","('C', 'D')","A) Electric field inside the metal object is zero\nB) Electric potential is constant throughout the metal object\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer.

We know that tension in the string is directly related to wave speed, and wave speed is inversely related to wavelength. So, increasing tension will result in an increase in wave speed and a decrease in wavelength.","('A', 'B')","A. Greater\nB. Less\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the answer. We know that the speed of a wave in a string is given by v = \u221a(T\/\u03bc), where T is the tension in the string and \u03bc is the linear mass density of the string. As tension is increased, the speed of the wave will also increase. Since v = f\u03bb, where f is the frequency and \u03bb is the wavelength, and the frequency remains constant, an increase in speed will result in a decrease in wavelength. Therefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be less than the wavelength of the original standing waves.","B"],["Two identical capacitors are hooked in parallel to an external circuit.

We know that the kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline will be less than the gravitational potential energy when it was released, due to the work done by the friction force. This eliminates options A and B. The kinetic energy will also be less than the gravitational potential energy because some of the energy is converted to thermal energy. Therefore, the most likely answer choices are (C, D).","('C', 'D')","A. Less than the potential energy at the top of the incline\nB. Equal to the potential energy at the top of the incline\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to determine the kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline. We need to consider the work done by friction as the object slides down the incline, which will result in a loss of mechanical energy. This means that the kinetic energy at the bottom will be less than the potential energy at the top of the incline.

Adding the small block of mass m on top of the original block will increase the total mass of the system. Since the frequency of oscillation in a spring-block oscillator is only dependent on the mass and the spring constant, and not on the amplitude, the frequency of oscillation will remain the same.","B"],["How much work is required to charge a 10 \u00b5F capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?","What is the work required to charge a 10 \u00b5F capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V?","- Capacitance (C) = 10 \u00b5F\n- Potential difference (V) = 100 V","find the work required to charge the capacitor.
