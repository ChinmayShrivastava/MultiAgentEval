We know that the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod and the electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder both decrease as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields. The electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge does not follow this behavior, and the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire is not relevant to the question.","('A', 'B')","produce the answer. We know that the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod and the electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder both decrease as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields. However, the electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder is the correct answer because it is a more general case and applies to a wider range of scenarios.","B"],["A solid, metal object is isolated from other charges and has charge distributed on its surface.

We know that for a solid metal object, the electric field inside the object is zero. This means that option B is not likely to be correct.

This leaves us with options A and D.","('A', 'D')","produce the answer. We know that for an isolated metal object, the electric field inside the object is zero. This means that the electric field outside the object, but very close to the surface, is equal to the surface charge density at any location divided by the permittivity of free space. Therefore, option d is the correct answer.","D"],["Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length.

We know that tension in the string is directly related to wave speed, and wave speed is inversely related to wavelength. So, increasing tension will result in an increase in wave speed and a decrease in wavelength.","('A', 'B')","produce the answer. We know that the tension in the string is directly related to the wave speed, which is inversely related to the wavelength. So, if the tension is increased, the wave speed will increase, and the wavelength will decrease. Therefore, the wavelength of the new standing waves will be less than the wavelength of the original standing waves.","A"],["Two identical capacitors are hooked in parallel to an external circuit.

Additionally, since the capacitors are identical, their capacitance must also be the same. Therefore, the quantities that must be the same for both capacitors are the voltage across the capacitor and the capacitance of the capacitor.","('B', 'C')","produce the answer.

We know that the object is sliding down a rough incline, so there will be some energy lost to friction. We also know that the object starts from rest at the top, so its initial kinetic energy is zero.","('C', 'D')","produce the answer. We know that the object is released from rest at the top of the incline, so it starts with only gravitational potential energy. As it slides down the incline, some of this energy is converted to kinetic energy. However, because the incline is rough, some of the energy is also converted to thermal energy due to friction. This means that the kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline will be less than the gravitational potential energy when it was released. Therefore, the correct answer is option c.","c"],["A student is experimenting with a simple spring-block oscillator of spring constant k and amplitude A.

We also need to consider the positions at which the small block is most likely to slide off.","('A', 'B')","produce the answer. We know that the maximum displacement of the original block is at the equilibrium position, so the small block is most likely to slide off at this point.

We can use the kinematic equations to find the total flight time of the soccer ball.
