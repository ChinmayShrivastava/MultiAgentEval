The response of New England Federalists to the War of 1812: The New England Federalists were opposed to the War of 1812 and even discussed secession at the Hartford Convention. Their opposition was based on economic and political reasons, and they expressed concerns about the overreach of federal power, which aligns with Calhoun's emphasis on state sovereignty and the division of powers.\n\nC. The response of the Jefferson administration to the actions of the \"Barbary pirates\": This refers to the conflict between the United States and the Barbary States in North Africa, where the Jefferson administration took military action to protect American interests. This situation does not involve issues of state sovereignty or the division of powers between state and federal governments.\n\nD. The response of Daniel Shays to fiscal policies of the Massachusetts legislature in the 1780s: Shays' Rebellion was an armed uprising in response to economic hardships and aggressive tax and debt collection policies.

The Tet Offensive took place in 1968 during the Vietnam War, which was a significant focus of Lyndon Johnson's presidency. Johnson escalated U.S. involvement in Vietnam to counter the spread of Communism.\nC. The economic aid to Turkey and Greece to undermine Communism refers to the Truman Doctrine, which was implemented in 1947, long before Johnson's presidency.\nD. The demand for the removal of the Berlin Wall was a significant issue during the Cold War, but it was not a primary focus of Johnson's presidency. The Berlin Wall was erected in 1961 and remained until 1989, with significant events related to it occurring after Johnson's term.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is B, as it aligns with Johnson's involvement in the Vietnam War and his efforts to undermine Communism in Vietnam after the Tet Offensive.\n\n","B","B"],["This question refers to the following information.\nThe 1980s have been born in turmoil, strife, and change.

Abraham Lincoln in the 1860s: Lincoln faced the Civil War, a domestic conflict centered on issues of slavery and states' rights. This situation is quite different from Carter's international and geopolitical challenges.\n\nB. Theodore Roosevelt in the 1900s: Roosevelt dealt with issues such as the regulation of big businesses, the construction of the Panama Canal, and the establishment of the United States as a global power. While there are some international elements, the context is not as closely aligned with Carter's specific challenges.\n\nC.

This does not closely match the international and geopolitical nature of Carter's challenges.\n\nD. Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s: FDR faced the Great Depression and the lead-up to World War II, dealing with both severe economic issues and rising global tensions, particularly with the Axis powers.

The success of the Libertarian party in national elections - The passage mentions that conservatism and libertarianism share some common principles, but it also notes that there are differences and that Reagan did not fully align with the Libertarian party. Historically, the Libertarian party has not had significant success in national elections, so this factor is unlikely to have contributed to the prominence of conservatism.\n\nB. The growth of religious fundamentalism - The rise of the Religious Right and the Moral Majority in the late 1970s and 1980s played a significant role in the conservative movement, making this a contributing factor.\n\nC. Perceived economic and foreign policy failures under President Carter - The economic struggles (stagflation) and foreign policy issues (Iran hostage crisis) during Carter's presidency led to a shift towards conservative policies, contributing to the prominence of conservatism.\n\nD. Social changes following the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War - The social upheaval and changes during and after the Civil Rights movement and Vietnam War led to a backlash that fueled conservative sentiments, making this a contributing factor.\n\nGiven this analysis, the factor that did not contribute to the prominence of conservatism is the success of the Libertarian party in national elections.\n\n","A","A"],["This question refers to the following information.\n\"In one view the slaveholders have a decided advantage over all opposition.
