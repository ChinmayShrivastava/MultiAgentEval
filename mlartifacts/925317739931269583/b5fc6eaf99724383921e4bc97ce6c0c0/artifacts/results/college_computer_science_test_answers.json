Each entry in the matrix specifies the access rights of a subject to an object. \n\n- Option A states that the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage. This is a well-known issue with the access matrix approach because the matrix can become very large, especially in systems with many subjects and objects, making it difficult to store and manage efficiently.\n\n- Option B claims that the access matrix is not capable of expressing complex protection requirements. This is not true because the access matrix is quite flexible and can represent a wide range of protection requirements.\n\n- Option C suggests that deciding whether a process has access to a resource is undecidable. This is incorrect because the access matrix explicitly defines the access rights, making it straightforward to determine whether a process has access to a resource.\n\n- Option D states that there is no way to express who has rights to change the access matrix itself. This is not accurate because the access matrix can include meta-rights that specify who can modify the access rights.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the correct answer is that the matrix, if stored directly, is large and can be clumsy to manage.\n\n","A","A"],["An integer c is a common divisor of two integers x and y if and only if c is a divisor of x and c is a divisor of y.

If the owner modifies the file, another user who does not share will see the changes.\n- This statement is incorrect because if a user does not share the file, they should not have access to it in the first place. Therefore, they would not see any changes.\n\nB.

This is because if every vertex had an incoming edge, there would be a cycle, which contradicts the definition of a DAG. Therefore, statement I must be true.\n\nII. G has a vertex with no outgoing edge.\n- Similarly, in a DAG, there must be at least one vertex with no outgoing edges. If every vertex had an outgoing edge, there would be a cycle, which again contradicts the definition of a DAG. Therefore, statement II must be true.\n\nIII. G has an isolated vertex, that is, one with neither an incoming edge nor an outgoing edge.\n- This statement is not necessarily true. An isolated vertex would imply that there is a vertex with no edges at all. However, the problem states that \\( |E| > 0 \\), meaning there is at least one edge in the graph.

The specific address 0x77E81234 in P\u2019s space corresponds to 0x01001234 in the debugger\u2019s space.\n\nMissing Data:\n\nNone","1. The debugger places a breakpoint at the load instruction at virtual address 0x77E81234 in the debugged process P.\n2. The text segment of process P begins at 0x77E80000 in P\u2019s virtual address space.\n3. The debugger has mapped this same text segment at 0x01000000 in its own virtual address space.\n\nTo find the corresponding virtual address in the debugger's virtual address space:\n- Calculate the offset of the load instruction within the text segment of process P:\n  Offset = 0x77E81234 - 0x77E80000 = 0x1234\n\n- Add this offset to the base address of the text segment in the debugger's virtual address space:\n  Debugger's virtual address = 0x01000000 + 0x1234 = 0x01001234\n\nNext, we need to determine the type of access the debugger has mapped for the virtual memory page containing this address:\n- Typically, when a debugger sets a breakpoint, it modifies the code by writing a special instruction (e.g., an interrupt) at the breakpoint location. This requires WRITE access to the memory page.\n- However, to avoid modifying the original code permanently, debuggers often use COPY-ON-WRITE access. This means that the original page is copied, and the debugger writes to the copy, leaving the original page unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the correct virtual address used by the debugger in its WRITE operation is 0x01001234, and the page is mapped with COPY-ON-WRITE access.\n\n","B","A"],["Which of the following considerations applies (apply) to choosing the page size in a paging system?\nI.

An advantage of smaller pages is that they lead to less waste due to internal fragmentation.\n- This is also true because smaller pages reduce the amount of unused memory within each page, thereby minimizing internal fragmentation.\n\nIII. Normally, the dominant factor in disk access time is not dependent on page length, so longer pages can be used advantageously.\n- This statement is generally true. Disk access time is often dominated by seek time and rotational latency, which are not significantly affected by the size of the pages being read or written.

M-7\u2019s pipeline has better maximum throughput than M-5\u2019s pipeline.\n- Throughput is determined by the clock cycle time. The shorter the clock cycle, the higher the throughput.\n- M-5 has a clock cycle of 10 nanoseconds.\n- M-7 has a clock cycle of 7.5 nanoseconds.\n- Since 7.5 nanoseconds is shorter than 10 nanoseconds, M-7 can process more instructions per unit time.\n- Therefore, statement I is true.\n\nII.

Write-back and write-through policies do not directly affect the hit ratio because they deal with how writes are handled, not how often data is found in the cache. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.\n\nB. **Write-through usually results in a better hit ratio than write-back.**\n   - Similar to option A, the hit ratio is not directly influenced by whether write-through or write-back is used. Therefore, this statement is also not necessarily true.\n\nC. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-back than for write-through.**\n   - In write-through, every write operation results in a main memory update. In write-back, main memory is updated only when a cache line is evicted. Therefore, the percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation can be smaller for write-back, but it cannot be larger than write-through. This statement is true.\n\nD. **The percentage of write operations resulting in a main memory operation will never be larger for write-through than for write-back.**\n   - This statement is incorrect because, in write-through, every write operation results in a main memory update, whereas in write-back, only evictions cause main memory updates.

Understand the replacement policy (e.g., LRU, FIFO, Random) to determine how cache lines are replaced.\nMissing Data:\n\n- Cache size: Not provided (essential for calculating the number of sets).\n- Block size: Not provided (essential for calculating offset bits and number of sets).\n- Address size: Not provided (essential for calculating tag bits).\n- Replacement policy: Not specified (impacts cache line replacement behavior).","To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of what a 3-way, set-associative cache is.\n\nA 3-way, set-associative cache means that each set in the cache can hold 3 blocks (or lines) of data. This is a compromise between a fully associative cache (where any block can go anywhere) and a direct-mapped cache (where each block has exactly one place it can go).\n\n- Option A: \"one in which each main memory word can be stored at any of 3 cache locations\"\n  This is correct because in a 3-way set-associative cache, each block of memory can be stored in any of the 3 locations within a set.\n\n- Option B: \"effective only if 3 or fewer processes are running alternately on the processor\"\n  This is incorrect because the effectiveness of a 3-way set-associative cache is not directly related to the number of processes running on the processor. It is related to how the cache handles memory access patterns.\n\n- Option C: \"possible only with write-back\"\n  This is incorrect because the associativity of a cache (3-way in this case) is independent of the write policy (write-back or write-through). A 3-way set-associative cache can use either write-back or write-through policies.\n\n- Option D: \"faster to access than a direct-mapped cache\"\n  This is incorrect because a direct-mapped cache is typically faster to access than a set-associative cache due to simpler indexing and fewer comparisons. Set-associative caches, including 3-way, generally have slightly more complex access times due to the need to check multiple locations within a set.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n","A","A"],["Consider an object-oriented language in which all entities are objects.

Instance relationship: between an object and the class of which that object is a member.\n  2. Subclass relationship: between a class and the superclass from which that class inherits properties.\n- Message sent to an object requests execution of one of its methods.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\n- No specific formulas are required; understanding of object-oriented principles is necessary.\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

If the method is not found in the object's class, follow the subclass relationship to the superclass.\n4. Continue checking up the inheritance hierarchy (superclasses) until the method is found.\n5. Execute the located method.\n\nMissing Data:\n\n- None","In an object-oriented language where all entities are objects, the relationships described are crucial for understanding how methods are located and executed. Let's break down the relationships and the process of method lookup:\n\n1. **Instance Relationship**: This is the relationship between an object and the class it belongs to. When a message (method call) is sent to an object, the first step is to identify the class of that object. This is done through the instance link.\n\n2. **Subclass Relationship**: This is the relationship between a class and its superclass. If the method is not found in the class of the object, the lookup process continues up the inheritance hierarchy, following the subclass links to the superclass, and so on, until the method is found or the top of the hierarchy is reached.\n\nGiven these relationships, the method lookup process can be described as follows:\n- Start with the object and follow the instance link to its class.\n- If the method is not found in that class, follow the subclass links (zero or more) up the inheritance hierarchy until the method is found or the top of the hierarchy is reached.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence involves starting with one instance link to find the class of the object, and then potentially following zero or more subclass links to locate the method in the inheritance hierarchy.\n\n","A","A"],["In a pipelined RISC computer where all arithmetic instructions have the same CPI (cycles per instruction), which of the following actions would improve the execution time of a typical program?\nI.

Increasing the clock cycle rate:\n- Increasing the clock cycle rate means that each cycle takes less time, which directly reduces the execution time of instructions. This would improve the overall execution time of the program.\n\nII. Disallowing any forwarding in the pipeline:\n- Forwarding (also known as bypassing) is a technique used to reduce the number of stalls in a pipeline by allowing data to be used as soon as it is available, rather than waiting for it to be written back to the register file. Disallowing forwarding would likely increase the number of stalls, thereby increasing the execution time of the program. This action would not improve execution time.\n\nIII. Doubling the sizes of the instruction cache and the data cache without changing the clock cycle time:\n- Increasing the sizes of the instruction cache and data cache can reduce the number of cache misses, which in turn reduces the number of memory access delays. This would improve the execution time of the program.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- Action I would improve execution time.\n- Action II would not improve execution time.\n- Action III would improve execution time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the combination of actions I and III.\n\n","D","D"],["A microcomputer used for data acquisition and control is required to digitize and process four analog input signals and to output their average continually; i.e., in real time.
