Support vector machines (SVMs) do not inherently provide a probability distribution over the possible labels. SVMs are primarily used for classification by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes. While there are methods to calibrate SVM outputs to obtain probabilities (e.g., Platt scaling), this is not a characteristic of the basic SVM model itself.

The support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary and are critical in defining the hyperplane. When changing from a linear kernel to higher-order polynomial kernels, the decision boundary becomes more complex and non-linear. As a result, the set of support vectors can change because the points that are closest to the new, more complex decision boundary may be different.\n\nGiven that both statements are false, the correct answer is:\n\n","B","B"],["A machine learning problem involves four attributes plus a class.

The kernel $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ is essentially an identity kernel. When convolving an image with this kernel, the central pixel value is retained, and all other values are zero, effectively leaving the image unchanged.\n\nC. The kernel $\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ is a box blur kernel. Convolving an image with this kernel would average the pixel values in the neighborhood, thus changing the image by blurring it.\n\nD. The kernel $\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ is a zero kernel. Convolving an image with this kernel would result in an image where all pixel values are zero, effectively turning the image black.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n","B","B"],["Which of the following is false?","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify the false statement from a given list of statements.\nKey Details:\n\n- List of statements provided (not given in the question)\n- Criteria for determining the truth or falsity of each statement (not provided)\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone (logical reasoning and factual verification required)\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

Semantic segmentation models predict the class of each pixel, while multiclass image classifiers predict the class of the entire image.\n- This statement is true. Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image, whereas multiclass image classification involves assigning a single class label to the entire image.\n\nB. A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to 96% would likely be considered a true positive.\n- This statement is true. An IoU of 96% indicates a high overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth, which would typically be considered a true positive.\n\nC. When a predicted bounding box does not correspond to any object in the scene, it is considered a false positive.\n- This statement is true. A predicted bounding box that does not match any actual object in the scene is indeed considered a false positive.\n\nD. A bounding box with an IoU (intersection over union) equal to 3% would likely be considered a false negative.\n- This statement is false. A bounding box with an IoU of 3% indicates very little overlap with the ground truth. It would more likely be considered a false positive if it is detected as an object but does not match well with any ground truth object. A false negative would be a case where an actual object is present but no bounding box is predicted.\n\n","D","D"],["Which of the following is false?","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify the false statement from a given list of options.\nKey Details:\n\n- List of statements provided (not given in the question)\n- Criteria or context to determine the truthfulness of each statement (not provided)\nRelevant Formulas:\n\n- Logical analysis or verification methods based on the context of the statements\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.
