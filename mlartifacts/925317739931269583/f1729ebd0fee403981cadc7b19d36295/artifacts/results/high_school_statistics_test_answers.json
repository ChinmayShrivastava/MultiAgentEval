Using stratified random sampling rather than simple random sampling can reduce bias by ensuring that specific subgroups within the population are adequately represented in the sample.\n\nD. Selecting samples randomly is a fundamental method to reduce selection bias, as it ensures that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample.\n\nGiven these evaluations, all options A, B, C, and D are methods that help reduce bias in a sample survey. Therefore, none of these options are least likely to reduce bias. However, since the question asks for the \"least likely\" option, we need to identify the one that is relatively less effective compared to the others.\n\nAmong the options, \"Selecting samples randomly\" (option D) is a basic method that reduces selection bias but does not address other types of bias (e.g., non-response bias, response bias) as effectively as the other options. Therefore, it is the least comprehensive in reducing overall bias.\n\n","D","C"],["For their first exam, students in an AP Statistics class studied an average of 4 hours with a standard deviation of 1 hour.

Since only 132 out of 1650 students have personal investments in the stock market, the probability of selecting a student with an investment in the stock market is relatively low.

This ensures that the sample consists only of students who have investments, leading to a more accurate estimate of the average investment among those who invest. Multiplying the confidence interval by 132 (the number of students with investments) will then provide a more accurate estimate of the total investment by these students.\n\nTherefore, Plan II is better because it focuses on the relevant subgroup of students who have investments, leading to a more accurate estimate of their average investment and, consequently, the total investment.\n\n","B","B"],["Sampling error occurs","Task Statement:\n\nExplain what sampling error is and how it occurs.\nKey Details:\n\n- Sampling error refers to the difference between a sample statistic and the corresponding population parameter.\n- It occurs because a sample, rather than the entire population, is used to estimate the population parameter.\n- The size and representativeness of the sample can affect the magnitude of the sampling error.\n- Larger samples tend to have smaller sampling errors.\n- Random sampling methods can help minimize sampling error.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\n- Sampling Error = Sample Statistic - Population Parameter\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

In this case, the expected number of failures for both males and females is less than 10, violating the assumptions required for the two-proportion z-test.","To determine if a two-proportion z-test is appropriate, we need to check certain conditions.

This introduces a form of bias known as convenience sampling, where the sample is biased towards homes that are easier to contact.\n\nConvenience samples tend to overestimate average results because they are more likely to include respondents who are more available or willing to participate, which may not be representative of the entire population. In this case, families with more children might be more likely to be at home and respond, leading to an overestimation of the average number of children.\n\nTherefore, the estimate of 1.73 children is likely too high due to the bias introduced by the convenience sampling method.\n\n","A","C"],["If all the values of a data set are the same, all of the following must equal zero except for which one?","Task Statement:\n\nDetermine which statistical measure does not equal zero when all values in a data set are the same.\nKey Details:\n\n- All values in the data set are identical.\n- Statistical measures to consider: variance, standard deviation, range, mean, median, mode.\nRelevant Formulas:\n\n- Variance (\u03c3\u00b2) = \u03a3(xi - \u03bc)\u00b2 \/ N\n- Standard Deviation (\u03c3) = \u221aVariance\n- Range = Maximum value - Minimum value\n- Mean (\u03bc) = \u03a3xi \/ N\n- Median: Middle value in an ordered data set\n- Mode: Most frequently occurring value in the data set\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

The probability of getting a Type II error.\n- A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. This probability is denoted by beta (\u03b2). The power of a test is related to Type II error but is not defined by it.\n\nD. The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is, in fact, false.\n- This is the correct definition of the power of a significance test. The power of a test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true. It is calculated as 1 - \u03b2.\n\nTherefore, the best description of the power of a significance test is given by option D.\n\n","D","D"],["A drug company will conduct a randomized controlled study on the effectiveness of a new heart disease medication called Heartaid.

Understand the definition of a Type II error in the context of the study.\n2. Identify the consequence of failing to reject H0 when HA is true:\n   - If a Type II error occurs, the study concludes that Heartaid is not more effective than the current medication, even though it actually is.\n3. Determine the potential consequence:\n   - Patients may continue using the less effective current medication.\n   - The benefits of Heartaid may not be realized, leading to potentially worse health outcomes for patients.\n   - The drug company may lose potential revenue from Heartaid.\n\nMissing Data:\n\n- Specific probabilities or sample sizes are not provided, but this does not impact the identification of the consequence of a Type II error.","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what a Type II error is in the context of hypothesis testing. A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is not rejected when it is actually false. In this case, the null hypothesis (H0) is that Heartaid and the current medication are equally effective at preventing heart disease, and the alternative hypothesis (HA) is that Heartaid is more effective than the current medication.\n\nA Type II error would mean that we fail to reject the null hypothesis even though Heartaid is actually more effective. Therefore, the consequence of a Type II error would be that patients continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. This describes a scenario where Heartaid is not more effective, but patients spend more money on it. This would be a consequence of a Type I error, not a Type II error.\nB. This also describes a scenario where Heartaid is not more effective, but doctors prescribe it. This would be a consequence of a Type I error, not a Type II error.\nC. This describes a scenario where patients continue to use the current medication, even though Heartaid is actually more effective. This is consistent with a Type II error.\nD. This describes a calculation error, which is not directly related to the definition of a Type II error.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n","C","C"],["Two classes take the same exam.

Compare the two percentiles to infer the relative performance of students in both classes.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- The score is relatively lower in the first class compared to the second class.\n- This suggests that the first class generally performed better on the exam than the second class, as a score that is only at the 40th percentile in the first class is at the 80th percentile in the second class.\n\nMissing Data:\n\n- Exact score value (not necessary for the conclusion).\n- Distribution of scores in each class (not necessary for the conclusion).","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what percentiles represent. A score at the 40th percentile means that 40% of the students scored below that score. Similarly, a score at the 80th percentile means that 80% of the students scored below that score.\n\nGiven that a certain score is at the 40th percentile for the first class and at the 80th percentile for the second class, it indicates that this score is relatively lower in the first class compared to the second class. In other words, more students in the second class scored below this score than in the first class.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\nA.
