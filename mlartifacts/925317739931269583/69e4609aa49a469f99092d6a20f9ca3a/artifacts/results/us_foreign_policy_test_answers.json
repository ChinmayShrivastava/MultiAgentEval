However, the benefits of free trade are often dispersed across the entire economy, leading to lower prices and more variety for consumers, as well as overall economic growth. On the other hand, the costs of free trade, such as job losses in industries that cannot compete with foreign competition, are concentrated among specific groups of workers and firms. These groups may lobby for protectionist measures to shield themselves from the negative impacts of free trade. This concentrated cost versus dispersed benefit dynamic often leads to political pressure to implement trade barriers, even though the overall economy might benefit from free trade.\n\n","B","B"],["Why did George H.W.
