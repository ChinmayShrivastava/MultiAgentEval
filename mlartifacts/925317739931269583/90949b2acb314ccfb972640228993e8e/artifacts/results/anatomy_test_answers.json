The internal capsule is a critical area where motor fibers pass through, and damage here can disrupt the transmission of motor signals from the brain to the muscles.\n\nWhen the motor neurons are damaged in the internal capsule, the result is typically a form of paralysis on the opposite side of the body (contralateral side) due to the crossing of motor pathways in the brainstem. In this case, the right leg would be affected.\n\nThe type of paralysis that occurs depends on the nature of the damage. Damage to the upper motor neurons (UMNs), which are located in the brain and spinal cord, often results in spastic paralysis. Spastic paralysis is characterized by increased muscle tone (hypertonia), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), and muscle stiffness.\n\nFlaccid paralysis, on the other hand, is associated with damage to the lower motor neurons (LMNs), which directly innervate the muscles. This type of paralysis is characterized by decreased muscle tone (hypotonia), loss of reflexes (areflexia), and muscle atrophy.\n\nTremor is an involuntary, rhythmic muscle contraction and relaxation involving oscillations or twitching movements of one or more body parts. It is not typically a direct result of a CVA in the internal capsule.\n\nHyporeflexia refers to reduced reflexes, which is more commonly associated with LMN damage rather than UMN damage.\n\nGiven that the CVA is in the area of the left internal capsule, which affects the UMNs, the patient's right leg will exhibit spastic paralysis.\n\n","A","A"],["The crown of a very carious tooth suddenly fractures while the patient is standing eating at a take-away food outlet and a fragment is inhaled.

However, the presence of mucous glands alone does not necessarily explain why oedema would be confined above the vocal folds.\n- Option B states that the mucosa covering the vocal folds is tightly attached to underlying tissues. This tight attachment would limit the space available for fluid accumulation, thereby preventing significant oedema below the vocal folds.\n- Option C implies that fluid will drain rapidly into the thorax below the vocal folds. This is less likely to be a primary reason for the confinement of oedema above the vocal folds.\n- Option D suggests that the mucosa above the vocal folds is more vascular than that below the vocal folds. While increased vascularity could contribute to fluid accumulation, it does not directly explain why oedema would be confined above the vocal folds.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible explanation is that the tight attachment of the mucosa to the underlying tissues in the vocal folds limits the space for fluid accumulation, thereby confining the oedema to the area above the vocal folds.\n\n","B","B"],["The coronary arteries","Task Statement:\n\nExplain the function and importance of the coronary arteries in the human body.\nKey Details:\n\n- Coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle.\n- They branch off from the aorta near the point where the aorta and the left ventricle meet.\n- There are two main coronary arteries: the left coronary artery (LCA) and the right coronary artery (RCA).\n- The LCA further divides into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the circumflex artery (Cx).\n- The RCA supplies blood to the right atrium, right ventricle, and bottom portion of both ventricles and the back of the septum.\n- The LAD supplies blood to the front and bottom of the left ventricle and the front of the septum.\n- The Cx supplies blood to the left atrium and the side and back of the left ventricle.\n- Blockages in these arteries can lead to coronary artery disease (CAD), which can cause heart attacks.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNot applicable (descriptive explanation required).\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

The rima glottis, which is the opening between the vocal cords, closes to prevent food from entering the trachea and lungs.\n4. The gag reflex is not typically suspended during swallowing; it is a protective reflex that can be triggered if something touches the back of the throat.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer is that the rima glottis closes during swallowing, which means the correct answer is not listed among the options.

Each spinal nerve has two roots: a dorsal (posterior) root and a ventral (anterior) root. The dorsal root contains the axons of sensory neurons, which carry sensory information from the body to the spinal cord. The ventral root contains the axons of motor neurons, which carry motor commands from the spinal cord to the muscles. Therefore, the dorsal roots specifically contain sensory neuronal processes.\n\n","A","A"],["Which of the following is the master gland of the endocrine system?","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify the master gland of the endocrine system.\nKey Details:\n\n- The endocrine system consists of various glands that secrete hormones.\n- The master gland is responsible for regulating the activity of other endocrine glands.\n- Common glands in the endocrine system include the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, and pancreas.\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone (This is a factual question, not requiring mathematical formulas)\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.
