According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the flag State, which is the state under whose laws the vessel is registered, generally has jurisdiction over the vessel and its activities, including crimes committed on board. This principle is based on the idea that the flag State has the authority to enforce its laws on its registered vessels, regardless of where the vessel is located.\n\nThe coastal State may have jurisdiction in certain circumstances, such as when the vessel is within its territorial waters, but this is not the general rule for all crimes committed on board vessels.

R2P is a broader concept that includes prevention, reaction, and rebuilding, whereas humanitarian intervention typically refers to the use of force to protect civilians.\n\nB. R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress.\n- This option is incorrect because R2P does not necessarily require a call for assistance by the state in distress. R2P can be invoked even if the state is unwilling or unable to protect its population.\n\nC. R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.\n- This option is correct. R2P is designed to be less arbitrary by involving the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and focusing on preventing or stopping humanitarian crises. This makes it more structured and regulated compared to unilateral humanitarian interventions.\n\nD. R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not.\n- This option is incorrect because R2P does not always involve armed force.

The case involved Mr. Kadi, who was listed by the UNSC as associated with terrorism, leading to the freezing of his assets. He challenged this listing on the grounds that it violated his fundamental rights.\n\nThe ECJ held that while the EU respects international law, including UNSC resolutions, it must ensure that such resolutions comply with fundamental rights as protected by EU law.

This is too restrictive as reparation can include other forms beyond just monetary compensation.\n- Option B states that reparation denotes only the physical restitution of the wrongful act. This is also too restrictive as reparation can include more than just physical restitution.\n- Option C states that reparation includes restitution, compensation, and satisfaction, either alone or alongside other forms of reparation. This is a comprehensive view that aligns with the broader understanding of reparation, which can include various forms to address the harm caused.\n- Option D states that the form of reparation is a matter for the responsible State to decide.

However, this does not specifically define unilateral acts.\n\nB. \"They are acts creating unilateral legal obligations to the acting State\" - This option suggests that unilateral acts are those that create legal obligations for the State that performs them.

Extra-territorial abduction refers to the act of forcibly bringing a person from one country to another without legal authorization. The key issue is whether such an act affects the jurisdiction of English courts and whether it constitutes an abuse of process that would lead to a stay of proceedings.\n\nOption A suggests that extra-territorial abduction constitutes an abuse of process and leads to a stay of proceedings. This implies that the courts would refuse to exercise jurisdiction due to the improper manner in which the defendant was brought before the court.\n\nOption B states that extra-territorial abduction gives rise to the abductor's liability but does not lead to a stay of proceedings. This implies that while the abductor may face legal consequences, the court would still proceed with the case.\n\nOption C argues that staying proceedings under such circumstances would prevent the administration of justice in respect of international criminals. This suggests that the courts should not stay proceedings to ensure that justice is served, even if the abduction was improper.\n\nOption D indicates that the courts may, but will seldom, stay proceedings in cases of extra-territorial abduction. This suggests that while the courts have the discretion to stay proceedings, they are unlikely to do so in most cases.\n\nGiven the options, the most accurate reflection of the legal position is that the courts have the discretion to stay proceedings but are unlikely to do so in most cases.
