This is typically driven by increased globalisation, where companies can choose to relocate to countries with more favorable (i.e., less stringent) regulations. The correct answer should reflect this concept.\n\n- \"Bottom\" is the correct term for the first blank, as it aligns with the phrase \"race to the bottom.\"\n- \"Globalisation\" is the correct term for the second blank, as it is the process that increases competition among countries for foreign investment.\n- \"Social\" and \"Environmental\" are the correct terms for the third and fourth blanks, as these are the standards that are often weakened in a race to the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n","A","A"],["Managers are entrusted to run the company in the best interest of ________.

Specifically, they have a duty to act for the benefit of the company, as well as a duty of loyalty and of care.","Managers are typically entrusted to run the company in the best interest of the shareholders, as they are the owners of the company. The duties of managers include acting for the benefit of the company, which involves exercising care and skill, and being diligent in their responsibilities. Self-interest is not a duty that managers are expected to uphold; rather, they should avoid self-interest to prevent conflicts of interest.\n\n- Option A mentions \"Shareholders, Care and Skill, Diligence,\" which aligns with the duties of managers.\n- Option B mentions \"Stakeholder, Care and Skill, Diligence,\" but the primary duty is to shareholders, not stakeholders in general.\n- Option C mentions \"Shareholders, Self-interest, Diligence,\" but self-interest is not a duty of managers.\n- Option D mentions \"Stakeholders, Care and skill, Self-interest,\" but again, the primary duty is to shareholders, and self-interest is not a duty.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n\n","A","A"],["Replacing supply chains with _______ enhances the importance of product _______as well as a fundamental redesign of every activity a firm engages in that produces _______.","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify the missing terms in the sentence to understand how replacing supply chains impacts product importance and firm activities.\nKey Details:\n\n- The sentence discusses the impact of replacing supply chains.\n- It mentions the importance of product (missing term).\n- It refers to a fundamental redesign of every activity a firm engages in that produces (missing term).\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNot applicable (contextual understanding required).\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

While this can be a sign of financial distress, it does not necessarily mean the company is insolvent. The company might still be able to meet its obligations through other means.\n\nB. Not meeting a budgeted level of profit indicates that the company is not performing as well as expected, but it does not directly imply insolvency. The company could still be solvent even if it is not as profitable as planned.\n\nC. Making a loss means that the company's expenses exceed its revenues. While sustained losses can lead to insolvency, a single loss does not necessarily mean the company is insolvent. The company might have sufficient reserves or other means to cover its obligations.\n\nD.
