It promotes the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the gut, which are essential for bone mineralization. In the case of vitamin D deficiency, there is a decrease in calcium absorption, leading to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels). The body responds to hypocalcemia by increasing the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Pepsinogen is the chief enzyme which digests protein and requires removal of a peptide sequence from the active cleft before it can work.\n- Pepsinogen is indeed an inactive precursor (zymogen) of pepsin, which digests proteins. However, pepsinogen is secreted by the stomach, not the pancreas. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nB. Pancreatic \u00e1-amylase will hydrolyse starch to free glucose.\n- Pancreatic \u03b1-amylase does hydrolyze starch, but it primarily breaks it down into maltose and dextrins, not free glucose. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nC. Enteropeptidase converts trypsinogen to trypsin by cleavage of a peptide sequence that blocks the active site of trypsin.\n- This statement is correct. Enteropeptidase, which is secreted by the cells of the duodenum, activates trypsinogen (a zymogen secreted by the pancreas) by cleaving a specific peptide sequence, thereby converting it into active trypsin.\n\nD. Pancreatic secretion of hydrochloric acid is required to provide the correct pH for maximal pancreatic enzyme in the duodenum.\n- The pancreas does not secrete hydrochloric acid; it secretes bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme from the stomach.

Carbohydrates: Elite athletes should consume 30-60 grams of carbohydrates per hour to maintain energy levels.\n2.

Glucose is a primary source of energy, but the body can only absorb a limited amount of glucose per hour. Research indicates that the maximum rate of glucose absorption is around 60 grams per hour. However, combining glucose with fructose can increase the total carbohydrate absorption rate because they use different transport mechanisms in the intestine. Studies have shown that consuming a combination of glucose and fructose can allow for a higher total carbohydrate intake, up to 90 grams per hour, which can enhance endurance performance and delay fatigue.\n\n","D","D"],["What endogenous substrate source provides the most energy during moderate to high intensity exercise?\n","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify the endogenous substrate source that provides the most energy during moderate to high intensity exercise.\nKey Details:\n\n- Endogenous substrate sources include carbohydrates (glycogen), fats (triglycerides), and proteins.\n- Moderate to high intensity exercise typically ranges from 60% to 85% of VO2 max.\n- Carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in muscles and liver.\n- Fats are stored as triglycerides in adipose tissue and muscle.\n- Proteins are generally not a primary energy source during exercise.\n- Glycogen is rapidly mobilized and utilized during higher intensity exercise.\n- Fat oxidation is slower and more suited for lower intensity, longer duration exercise.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\n- Energy yield from carbohydrates: 4 kcal\/g\n- Energy yield from fats: 9 kcal\/g\n- Energy yield from proteins: 4 kcal\/g (not typically considered for moderate to high intensity exercise)\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

Among the carbohydrate sources, muscle glycogen is the most readily available and can be quickly broken down to glucose to provide energy for muscle contractions. Liver glycogen also contributes to blood glucose levels, but it is not as directly accessible to the working muscles as muscle glycogen. Lipids, whether from intramuscular stores or adipose tissue, are more important during prolonged, lower intensity exercise because their mobilization and oxidation are slower processes compared to glycogen breakdown.\n\n","B","B"],["How does agricultural research help reduce hunger and poverty?\n","Task Statement:\n\nExplain how agricultural research helps reduce hunger and poverty.\nKey Details:\n\n- Agricultural research focuses on improving crop yields, pest resistance, and farming techniques.\n- Enhanced crop yields lead to increased food production.\n- Improved pest resistance reduces crop losses.\n- Advanced farming techniques optimize resource use (water, soil, fertilizers).\n- Research can lead to the development of drought-resistant and disease-resistant crop varieties.\n- Increased food production can lower food prices, making food more accessible.\n- Higher crop yields and efficient farming can increase farmers' incomes.\n- Economic growth in rural areas can result from improved agricultural productivity.\n- Better food security can lead to improved health and educational outcomes.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNot applicable (qualitative analysis).\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

Agricultural research mainly benefits commercial farmers in developed countries.\n- This option suggests that agricultural research does not focus on poor farmers and consumers, which contradicts the idea of reducing hunger and poverty.\n\nC. Research focused on the problems of poor farmers and consumers is a 'public good' with little profit potential but high social benefits; public investment is needed to support it.\n- This option correctly identifies that research aimed at helping poor farmers and consumers is a public good, meaning it has high social benefits but low profit potential. Therefore, public investment is necessary to support such research, which can help reduce hunger and poverty.\n\nD.

Subsistence farming refers to farmers growing food primarily for their own consumption, while commercial farming involves growing crops for sale in the market. \n\nOption A states that almost all are subsistence farmers, which suggests that most farmers do not engage in market sales. This is unlikely as many farmers in developing countries do engage in some form of market activity to supplement their income.\n\nOption B states that very few engage in subsistence production and instead sell almost all of their produce on the market. This is also unlikely because many small-scale farmers in developing countries rely on their produce for their own consumption.\n\nOption C states that virtually all small-scale producers engage in some self-provisioning and market sales. This is a balanced view, recognizing that while many farmers grow food for their own consumption, they also sell some of their produce in the market to earn income.\n\nOption D states that 37% engage in pure subsistence production.
