This includes principles like just cause, legitimate authority, right intention, probability of success, last resort, and proportionality.\n  \n- Jus in bello, on the other hand, refers to the principles that govern the conduct of parties during the war. This includes principles like distinction (discriminating between combatants and non-combatants), proportionality (using force proportionate to the military advantage gained), and military necessity.\n\nThe principle of military necessity, which dictates that military actions must be necessary to achieve a legitimate military objective and not cause excessive harm, clearly falls under the category of jus in bello.\n\nMoral nihilism, mentioned in option C, is a philosophical position that suggests that moral truths do not exist, which is unrelated to just war theory.\n\nOption D, \"all of the above,\" cannot be correct because moral nihilism is not related to just war theory, and the principle of military necessity does not belong to both jus in bello and jus ad bellum simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the principle of military necessity belongs to jus in bello.\n\n","A","A"],[" According to Mill, censoring speech that is possibly true","Task Statement:\n\nDetermine John Stuart Mill's perspective on censoring speech that is possibly true.\nKey Details:\n\n- John Stuart Mill is a philosopher known for his work on liberty and free speech.\n- Mill argues that free speech is essential for the pursuit of truth.\n- Censoring speech, even if it is only possibly true, can prevent the discovery of truth.\n- Mill's principle emphasizes the importance of allowing all opinions to be heard and debated.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone (philosophical argument)\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

This suggests that feminist rhetoric creates a binary where noncoerced sex is automatically considered good, potentially ignoring any harms that might still be present in consensual sex.\n\nOption B states that feminist rhetoric obscures the harms of rape by equating all sex with nonconsensual sex.

Thomson argues that you are not morally obligated to remain connected to the violinist for that duration, drawing a parallel to pregnancy and the right to bodily autonomy.\n\nIn the modified scenario where the violinist only needs to use your kidneys for one hour, Thomson's view is nuanced. She acknowledges that while it may be morally good or praiseworthy to allow the violinist to use your kidneys for that hour, it does not necessarily translate into a moral obligation or a right for the violinist to use your kidneys. This distinction is crucial in her argument about the limits of bodily autonomy and moral obligations.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer is that even though you ought to let the violinist use your kidneys for that hour, it does not mean the violinist has a right to use your kidneys for that hour.\n\n","D","D"],[" Fine asks us to consider the example of a yoga group that practices in Central Park and is free to reject prospective members but isn't free to exclude others from making use of Central Park.

Option B suggests that Papadaki argues sexual objectification involves the total reduction of a person to an object. This implies a complete and absolute transformation of a person into an object.\n3. Option C suggests that Papadaki argues sexual objectification is not explainable in Kantian terms. This implies a critique of Kantian ethics in explaining sexual objectification.\n4. Option D suggests that Papadaki argues sexual objectification involves the denial of a person's humanity. This implies that objectification fundamentally disregards the human essence of the person.\n\nGiven these options, the most nuanced and specific argument that aligns with philosophical discussions on sexual objectification is Option A.

This could diminish the sense of humility that comes from recognizing the limits of human power and the role of chance in our lives.\n\nAdditionally, Sandel argues that genetic enhancement could increase the burden of responsibility on individuals, as parents might feel compelled to enhance their children to ensure their success, and individuals might feel pressured to enhance themselves to compete with others. This increased sense of responsibility could be overwhelming and detrimental to well-being.\n\nFinally, Sandel contends that genetic enhancement could erode solidarity, the sense of shared fate and mutual support among people.

This seems plausible because acknowledging backup duties implies a recognition of the limitations of effective altruism while still addressing the criticism constructively.\n\nB.
