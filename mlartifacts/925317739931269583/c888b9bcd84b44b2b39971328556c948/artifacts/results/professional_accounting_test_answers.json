Since the effect is not material, the auditor should:\n   - Ensure the change is disclosed in the financial statements.\n   - Confirm that the change is in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.\n   - Issue an unmodified opinion, as the immaterial change does not affect the overall fairness of the financial statements.\nMissing Data:\n\nNone (All necessary information is provided to determine the auditor's course of action.)","When there is a change in accounting principles, the auditor's response depends on the materiality of the change and its impact on the comparability of the financial statements. If the change is not material, it means that the change does not significantly affect the financial statements' comparability or the users' understanding of the financial statements. In such cases, the auditor does not need to highlight the change in the auditor's report because it does not significantly impact the overall financial statements.\n\nOption A suggests that the auditor should not refer to the change in the auditor\u2019s report, which aligns with the idea that if the change is not material, it does not need to be highlighted.\n\nOption B suggests referring to the note in the financial statements that discusses the change. While the financial statements may include a note about the change, the auditor's report itself does not need to refer to it if the change is not material.\n\nOption C suggests referring to the change in an emphasis-of-matter paragraph. This is typically done when the change is material and needs to be highlighted for the users of the financial statements, which is not the case here.\n\nOption D suggests explicitly stating whether the change conforms with GAAP.

Will Frost or Frost's legal representative be liable to Grant?","Task Statement:\n\nDetermine if Frost or Frost's legal representative will be liable to Grant Corp. for an order placed by Long after Frost was declared incompetent.\n\nKey Details:\n\n- Long: Purchasing agent for Frost.\n- Frost: Sole proprietor, declared incompetent in a judicial proceeding.\n- Long's Authority: Express authority to place purchase orders with suppliers.\n- Method of Business: Conducted on the Internet, minimal contact with Frost.\n- Order Placement: Long placed an order with Grant Corp. after Frost's incompetence declaration.\n- Awareness: Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\n- Legal principle: Agency law regarding the authority of agents and the impact of the principal's incompetence.\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1. Identify the type of authority Long had (express authority).\n2. Determine the impact of Frost's incompetence on Long's authority.\n3. Assess whether Long's lack of knowledge about Frost's incompetence affects liability.\n4. Evaluate if Frost's legal representative inherits liability for actions taken by Long under express authority.\n\nMissing Data:\n\n- Specific legal jurisdiction (could impact the application of agency law principles).\n- Exact timing of the order relative to the incompetence declaration (may affect the analysis but not explicitly stated as missing).\n\nConclusion:\n\nBased on agency law principles, typically, the authority of an agent terminates upon the principal's incompetence. However, if the agent and third party are unaware of the incompetence, the principal (or their legal representative) may still be liable for the agent's actions taken in good faith. Therefore, Frost's legal representative is likely liable to Grant Corp. for the order placed by Long.","To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the legal principles surrounding agency and the effect of a principal's incompetence on an agent's authority.\n\n1. **Agency and Authority**: Long had express authority to place purchase orders on behalf of Frost. This means Long was acting within the scope of his authority when he placed the order with Grant Corp.\n\n2. **Effect of Incompetence**: Generally, an agent's authority is terminated when the principal is declared incompetent, unless the agent has a durable power of attorney or some other form of authority that explicitly survives the principal's incompetence.\n\n3. **Knowledge of Incompetence**: Both Long and Grant were unaware of Frost's incompetence at the time the order was placed. This lack of knowledge is crucial because it affects whether the transaction can be considered valid.\n\n4. **Legal Liability**: If an agent acts within the scope of their authority without knowledge of the principal's incompetence, the principal (or the principal's legal representative) may still be liable for the agent's actions. This is because the agent was acting in good faith and within their authority.\n\nGiven these points, the correct answer should reflect that Frost's legal representative would be liable because Long acted within his authority and without knowledge of Frost's incompetence.\n\n","B","D"],["Which of the following factors should an external auditor obtain updated information about when assessing an internal auditor\u2019s competence?","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify the factors an external auditor should obtain updated information about when assessing an internal auditor\u2019s competence.\nKey Details:\n\n- The competence of an internal auditor is crucial for the reliability of their work.\n- Factors influencing competence may include education, experience, certifications, and ongoing training.\n- The external auditor needs to ensure the internal auditor's skills and knowledge are current and relevant.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNot applicable (qualitative assessment).\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

In this scenario, the taxpayer is making premium payments on an insurance policy where the beneficiaries are his two children.\n\nEach premium payment made by the taxpayer is considered a gift to the beneficiaries because the beneficiaries will receive the proceeds of the insurance policy upon the taxpayer's death. Since there are two beneficiaries, each premium payment is effectively split into two gifts, one to each child.\n\nTherefore, each premium payment results in two gifts of property for gift tax purposes.\n\n","C","A"],["The City of Windemere decided to construct several large windmills to generate electrical power.

If there is substantial authority for the position, penalties generally do not apply.\n\n2. **More Likely Than Not**: This standard means that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the position will be upheld. This is a stringent standard and if met, penalties would not apply.\n\n3. **Reasonable Possibility of Success**: This is a lower standard than \"more likely than not\" and \"substantial authority.\" It implies that there is some chance of success, but it is not as rigorous as the other standards.\n\n4. **Reasonable Basis**: This is the lowest standard and requires that the position is reasonably based on one or more authorities. It is less stringent than \"substantial authority\" and \"more likely than not.\"\n\nGiven these standards, the IRS generally does not impose penalties if the position taken on the tax return has substantial authority or if it is more likely than not to be upheld.

This period can be extended to six years if there is a substantial understatement of income (more than 25% of gross income). There is no statute of limitations if fraud is involved.\n\n2. **Year of Examination**: The IRS agent completed the examination of the corporation\u2019s year 5 tax return in year 6. The proposed adjustment affects years 1 through 5.\n\n3. **Nature of Adjustment**: The adjustment relates to the disallowance of corporate jet usage for personal reasons. The agent does not find the error to be fraudulent or substantial in nature.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Since the error is neither fraudulent nor substantial, the standard three-year statute of limitations applies.\n- The returns for years 1 through 4 would be outside the three-year statute of limitations, assuming they were filed on the original due date.\n- Year 5 would still be within the three-year statute of limitations if the return was filed on the original due date.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n- **Option A**: Incorrect. An agent can propose adjustments for multiple years if they are within the statute of limitations.\n- **Option B**: Incorrect. There is a statute of limitations for claiming personal expenses as business expenses.\n- **Option C**: Incorrect. The adjustment does not relate to a change in accounting method.\n- **Option D**: Correct. The statute of limitations has expired for years 1 through 4, making the adjustment improper for those years.\n\n","D","D"],["Hall Co. purchased a machine on January 1 at a cost of $140000.

The CPA could potentially address this issue through engagement terms or additional planning.\n  \n- Option B: The inability to review the predecessor auditor's working papers is a concern, but it is not necessarily a deal-breaker. The CPA can still perform the audit by obtaining sufficient evidence through other means.\n\n- Option C: Management's unwillingness to make all financial records available to the CPA is a significant issue. Access to all financial records is essential for the CPA to conduct a thorough and accurate audit. Without this access, the CPA cannot obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form an opinion on the financial statements.\n\n- Option D: The CPA's lack of understanding of the entity's operations and industry is a concern, but it can be mitigated through research, training, or consultation with experts. It does not necessarily preclude accepting the engagement.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most critical factor that would cause a CPA not to accept a new audit engagement is management's unwillingness to make all financial records available, as it directly impedes the CPA's ability to perform the audit.\n\n","C","C"],["Which of the following pairs of elements must a client prove to hold an accountant liable for common law fraud?","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify the pairs of elements a client must prove to hold an accountant liable for common law fraud.\nKey Details:\n\n- The context involves holding an accountant liable for common law fraud.\n- Common law fraud typically requires proving specific elements.\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNot applicable (legal principles instead of mathematical formulas).\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

This action, especially if taken in response to similar actions by competitors, can have several potential effects:\n\n1. **Average Collection Period**: The average collection period is the average number of days it takes for a company to receive payment from its customers. Extending the credit period from 30 to 60 days would logically increase the average collection period because customers now have more time to pay.\n\n2. **Bad Debt Losses**: Bad debt losses occur when customers fail to pay their invoices. Extending the credit period does not directly affect the likelihood of customers defaulting on their payments.

While pervasive related party transactions might raise concerns about conflicts of interest or financial manipulation, proper disclosure generally mitigates the risk of illegality.\n\nB. The entity prepared several large checks payable to cash during the year.\n- Preparing large checks payable to cash is unusual and can be a red flag for illegal activities such as embezzlement, money laundering, or other forms of financial misconduct. This practice lacks transparency and makes it difficult to trace the flow of funds, raising significant concerns about potential illegal acts.\n\nC. Material internal control weaknesses previously reported to management were not corrected.\n- While failing to correct internal control weaknesses is a serious issue that can lead to financial misstatements or fraud, it does not directly indicate illegal acts.

Understand the impact of writing off variances directly to cost of goods sold:\n   - Increases cost of goods sold.\n   - Decreases net income.\n   - No direct impact on current assets or current liabilities, hence no impact on current ratio.\n\n2. Understand the impact of allocating variances to work in process, finished goods, and cost of goods sold:\n   - Spreads the unfavorable variances across multiple accounts.\n   - Reduces the immediate increase in cost of goods sold.\n   - Potentially increases inventory values (work in process and finished goods).\n   - Higher inventory values increase current assets.\n   - Higher current assets improve the current ratio.\n   - Lower immediate expense in cost of goods sold increases net income.\n\n3.

Some of the unfavorable variances would be allocated to WIP and finished goods inventory, which are balance sheet accounts. This means that the immediate impact on COGS and net income would be less severe.\n\n4. **Current Ratio**: The current ratio is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. Allocating the variances to WIP and finished goods increases inventory (a current asset), which would increase the current ratio.\n\n5. **Net Income**: Since allocating the variances spreads the cost over WIP, finished goods, and COGS, the immediate hit to net income would be less compared to writing them off directly to COGS. Therefore, net income would be higher when variances are allocated.\n\nBased on this reasoning, allocating the variances to WIP, finished goods, and COGS would increase the current ratio and increase net income.\n\n","A","A"],["While performing certain nonaudit services for an insurance company, a professional accountant is asked to recommend the appropriate accounting treatment for a weather hedge transaction.
