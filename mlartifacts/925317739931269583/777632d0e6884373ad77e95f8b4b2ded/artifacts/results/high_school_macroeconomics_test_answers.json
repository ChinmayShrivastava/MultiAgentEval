Understand the effects of expansionary fiscal policy:\n   - Increased government spending (G) or decreased taxes leads to higher aggregate demand (AD).\n2. Analyze the impact on real output and price level:\n   - A large increase in real output suggests that the economy has unused capacity or resources.\n   - A small increase in the price level indicates that the aggregate supply (AS) is relatively elastic, meaning it can increase output without a significant rise in prices.\n3. Infer the economic conditions:\n   - The economy likely has slack (unemployment or underutilized resources) allowing for significant output growth without causing high inflation.\n\nMissing Data:\n\n- Specific numerical values for government spending, taxes, real output, and price level changes are not provided. However, this does not impact the qualitative inference about the relationship between fiscal policy, output, and price level.","An expansionary fiscal policy typically involves increasing government spending or decreasing taxes to stimulate economic activity. If this policy leads to a large increase in real output and only a small increase in the price level, it suggests that the economy had the capacity to increase production without causing significant inflation. This scenario is consistent with the presence of unemployed resources (such as labor and capital) that can be utilized to increase output. If the economy initially had some unemployed resources, it would be able to expand production significantly without a corresponding large increase in prices. This is because the additional demand can be met by increasing output rather than bidding up prices.\n\nA. Inflation had already impacted the economy before the fiscal stimulus: This option does not explain why the fiscal policy led to a large increase in output with only a small increase in the price level.\nB. The economy initially had some unemployed resources: This option explains that the economy had the capacity to increase output significantly without causing a large increase in prices, which aligns with the given scenario.\nC. Aggregate supply decreased: If aggregate supply had decreased, it would likely lead to higher prices rather than a small increase in the price level.\nD. Aggregate demand is steeply sloped: A steeply sloped aggregate demand curve would imply that changes in output have a large impact on the price level, which contradicts the scenario of a small increase in the price level.\n\n","B","B"],["Which of the following is included in U.S. GDP?

However, the effect on the price level is uncertain because the increase in AD pushes the price level up while the increase in SRAS pushes the price level down.

A depreciating dollar might affect foreign investment in Treasury bonds but is not a direct cause of falling bond prices. Therefore, option C is less likely.

However, the general relationships are sufficient to understand the conditions under which households demand more money as an asset.","To determine the correct answer, we need to understand the relationship between households' demand for money as an asset and the given options.\n\n- Option A: If nominal GDP falls, it generally indicates a reduction in economic activity. Households might demand less money for transactions, but this does not directly relate to money as an asset.\n\n- Option B: If the nominal interest rate falls, the opportunity cost of holding money decreases. This means that households are less incentivized to invest in interest-bearing assets and more likely to hold money as an asset instead.\n\n- Option C: If bond prices fall, the yield on bonds increases (since bond prices and yields are inversely related). This would make bonds more attractive as an investment compared to holding money, so households would likely demand less money as an asset.\n\n- Option D: If the supply of money falls, it generally means there is less money available in the economy.

To counteract this, fiscal policy measures such as decreasing taxes for consumers and increasing government spending are often implemented. \n\n1. **Decreasing Taxes for Consumers**: This increases disposable income for consumers, leading to higher consumer spending. Higher consumer spending boosts aggregate demand.\n2. **Increasing Government Spending**: This directly increases aggregate demand as the government purchases more goods and services.\n\nBoth measures aim to increase aggregate demand in the economy. When aggregate demand increases, it typically leads to an increase in real GDP because more goods and services are being produced to meet the higher demand. Additionally, higher aggregate demand can lead to higher price levels due to increased pressure on supply.\n\nTherefore, the combined effect of decreasing taxes and increasing government spending during a recession is likely to result in an increase in both real GDP and the price level.\n\n","C","C"],["Sue loses her job at a shoe factory when the economy falls into a recession.

When the world price of rice is lower than the domestic price, it means that rice can be purchased more cheaply from international sources than from domestic producers. This price difference creates an incentive for consumers in the United States to buy rice from the world market rather than from domestic producers.\n\nAs a result, domestic producers will face reduced demand for their higher-priced rice, leading to a surplus of rice in the domestic market. To address this surplus, the United States would not export rice, as exporting would not be competitive given the lower world price. Instead, the United States would import rice to meet consumer demand at the lower world price, which would help eliminate the domestic surplus by reducing the quantity of domestically produced rice that needs to be sold at the higher domestic price.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that the United States begins to import rice to eliminate a domestic surplus.\n\n","A","A"],["Which of the following is NOT a major cost of inflation?","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify which option is NOT a major cost of inflation.\nKey Details:\n\n- Major costs of inflation typically include:\n  - Shoe leather costs: Increased costs of transactions due to people holding less cash.\n  - Menu costs: Costs to firms of changing prices.\n  - Uncertainty and confusion: Difficulty in planning and making long-term decisions.\n  - Redistribution of wealth: Inflation can benefit borrowers and hurt lenders.\n  - Tax distortions: Inflation can alter the real value of taxes paid.\n- The question asks to identify an option that does not fall under these categories.\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

In this case, even if the central bank increases the money supply, it will not lead to a significant change in interest rates or stimulate economic activity, thus limiting the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy.\n\nB.

This would imply that even if the central bank lowers interest rates through expansionary monetary policy, it would not lead to a significant increase in investment, thus limiting the policy's effectiveness.\n\nC.

A temporary expansionary supply shock would reduce inflation (or even cause deflation) while increasing output, which would lower the unemployment rate in the short run.\n\n4. **Short-Run Unemployment Rate**: Given the increase in output and lower prices, firms would need more labor to produce the increased output, thus reducing the short-run unemployment rate.\n\n5. **Long-Run Unemployment Rate**: Since the shock is temporary, the long-run unemployment rate would eventually return to its natural rate, which is unchanged by temporary supply shocks.\n\n6. **Effect on the Short-Run Phillips Curve**: The reduction in inflation and unemployment would shift the short-run Phillips curve downwards.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n- The short-run Phillips curve shifts down.\n- The short-run unemployment rate falls.\n- The long-run unemployment rate remains unchanged (returns to its natural rate).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n","C","A"],["Given the table below which statement is true?
