The passage suggests that this indigenous violence was a reaction to the systemic and official violence imposed by the British on the colonized Indians. Therefore, the Cawnpore Massacre can be viewed as a response to the oppressive and violent nature of British colonial rule.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not discuss local military customs or Western military norms.\nOption B is correct because it aligns with the passage's argument that the massacre was a reaction to the systemic brute force of British governance.\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not explicitly praise the massacre as a patriotic act.\nOption D is incorrect because the passage does not provide evidence of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\n\n","B","B"],["This question refers to the following information.\nThe passage below is taken from testimony before Parliament.\nJoshua Drake, called in; and Examined.\nYou say you would prefer moderate labour and lower wages; are you pretty comfortable upon your present wages?\n\u2014I have no wages, but two days a week at present; but when I am working at some jobs we can make a little, and at others we do very poorly.\nWhen a child gets 3s. a week, does that go much towards its subsistence?\n\u2014No, it will not keep it as it should do.\nWhy do you allow your children to go to work at those places where they are ill-treated or over-worked?\n\u2014Necessity compels a man that has children to let them work.\nThen you would not allow your children to go to those factories under the present system, if it was not from necessity?\n\u2014No.\n\u2014Testimony given before the Sadler Committee, 1831\u201332\nAccording to the passage, why does the witness allow his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated?","Task Statement:\n\nDetermine why the witness allows his children to work in a place where they will be ill-treated according to the passage.\n\nKey Details:\n\n- Witness: Joshua Drake\n- Current employment: No wages, only two days of work per week\n- Income variability: Some jobs provide a little income, others very poorly\n- Child's wage: 3 shillings a week, insufficient for proper subsistence\n- Reason for allowing children to work: Necessity compels him\n- Witness's stance: Would not allow children to work under current conditions if not for necessity\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized.

During the period 600\u20131450 C.E., significant events include the rise of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century and the subsequent expansion of the Islamic Caliphates. The Sassanian Empire (Persia) was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate in the mid-7th century, leading to Persia becoming part of the Islamic world. Over time, Persia (under various dynasties such as the Abbasids, Seljuks, and Safavids) became integrated into the broader Islamic civilization, which was heavily influenced by Arabian culture and religion.\n\nGiven this historical context, the most accurate description of Persia's relationship with Arabia during 600\u20131450 C.E. is that Persia was brought into the Arabian orbit over the course of the period, reflecting the significant influence of Islamic culture and political structures originating from Arabia.\n\n","D","D"],["This question refers to the following information.\nNew York!

Both the Mongols and the Persians allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures.\n- The passage mentions that the Mongol khans tolerated virtually all religions and facilitated peaceful coexistence among once-hostile peoples. This suggests that the Mongols allowed conquered peoples to maintain their local traditions and cultures. Historically, the Persian Empire under rulers like Cyrus the Great is also known for allowing a degree of cultural and religious autonomy to conquered peoples. This option seems plausible.\n\nB. The Mongols invested in building large-scale monuments, whereas the Persians focused on public works.\n- The passage does not mention the Mongols investing in large-scale monuments. Historically, the Mongols were more focused on military conquest and administration rather than monumental architecture. The Persians, on the other hand, are known for both monumental architecture (e.g., Persepolis) and public works (e.g., the Royal Road). This option does not accurately reflect the historical focus of the Mongols.\n\nC. Both the Persians and the Mongols improved the social, economic, and legal status of women.\n- The passage does not provide information about the status of women in either the Mongol or Persian empires. Historically, there is limited evidence to suggest that either empire significantly improved the status of women in a broad sense. This option is not supported by the passage or historical context.\n\nD. The Mongols created a new syncretic belief system, but the Persians maintained a traditional monotheistic religion.\n- The passage mentions that the Mongols tolerated various religions but does not indicate that they created a new syncretic belief system. Historically, the Mongols were religiously tolerant but did not create a new unified belief system. The Persians, particularly under the Achaemenid Empire, practiced Zoroastrianism, which is a monotheistic religion.

But, on the other hand, to put to hazard by a contrary course the very safety of the British Empire in India is an alternative which itself may be considered a still greater evil. When we had powerful neighbours and greater reason to doubt our own security, expediency might recommend a more cautious proceeding, but now that we are supreme my opinion is decidedly in favour of an open and general prohibition.\nWilliam Bentinck, Govenor-General of India, \"On the Suppression of Sati,\" 1829\nI have made it my study to examine the nature and character of the Indians [who trade with us], and however repugnant it may be to our feelings, I am convinced they must be ruled with a rod of iron, to bring and keep them in a proper state of subordination, and the most certain way to effect this is by letting them feel their dependence on [the foodstuffs and manufactured goods we sell them].\nGeorge Simpson, Head of Northern Department, Hudson's Bay Company, 1826\nThe first passage can be said to undermine which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism?","Task Statement:\n\nIdentify which commonly held assumption about Western imperialism is undermined by the first passage.\nKey Details:\n\n- The first passage is by William Bentinck, Governor-General of India, discussing the practice of sati in 1829.\n- Bentinck highlights the moral dilemma of continuing or discontinuing sati:\n  - Continuing sati results in the death of innocent victims.\n  - Discontinuing sati might endanger the British Empire's safety in India.\n- Bentinck ultimately supports the prohibition of sati, citing British supremacy as a reason for decisive action.\n- The second passage by George Simpson (1826) is not directly relevant to the task but provides context on British attitudes towards ruling their colonies.\n\nRelevant Formulas:\n\nNone (qualitative analysis).\n\nSteps to Solve:\n\n1. Identify the commonly held assumptions about Western imperialism:\n   - Western imperialism is often justified as a civilizing mission.\n   - Western powers are seen as morally superior and benevolent rulers.\n2. Analyze Bentinck's argument:\n   - He acknowledges the moral horror of sati.\n   - He also considers the political consequences of banning sati.\n   - His decision to prohibit sati is based on British power and control, not purely moral grounds.\n3. Determine which assumption is undermined:\n   - The assumption that Western imperialism is solely a moral and civilizing mission is undermined.\n   - Bentinck's argument shows that political and strategic considerations are also crucial.\n\nMissing Data:\n\nNone (all necessary information is provided).","The first passage by William Bentinck discusses the dilemma of whether to continue or discontinue the practice of sati, a traditional Hindu funeral custom where a widow self-immolates on her husband's pyre.

He ultimately advocates for prohibition, suggesting that the British Empire's supreme position allows for such a decision.\n\nTo determine which assumption about Western imperialism this passage undermines, we need to analyze the options:\n\nA. That European colonizers sometimes interfered with native religious practices - The passage supports this assumption because Bentinck is advocating for the prohibition of sati, which is an interference with a native religious practice.\n\nB. That European colonizers concerned themselves deeply with turning profits - The passage does not address economic concerns or profits, so it neither supports nor undermines this assumption.\n\nC. That European colonizers were uniformly eager to force their cultural norms on native populations - The passage undermines this assumption because Bentinck is not uniformly eager to impose British norms; he is weighing the moral responsibility against the potential political consequences, indicating a more nuanced approach.\n\nD.

He who wishes to marry among them can marry, but the women do not travel with the husband, and if one of them wanted to do that, she would be prevented by her family. The women there have friends and companions amongst men outside the prohibited degrees of marriage [i.e., other than brothers, fathers, etc.].

Assess how these factors might influence the practice of veiling among women.\n\nMissing Data:\n\n- Specific reasons or historical context for the cultural practices described.\n- Direct statements from women or other sources explaining the absence of veiling.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe likely cause of women not wearing the veil in Mali during the 1300s could be attributed to the unique social structure and cultural practices, including the lack of sexual jealousy, the matrilineal inheritance system, and the open social interactions between men and women. These factors suggest a society with different norms regarding modesty and gender relations compared to other Muslim societies of the time.","The passage describes the customs of the people in Mali during the 1300s, as observed by Ibn Battuta. It mentions that the women do not veil themselves despite their adherence to Islamic practices. This suggests that the practice of not veiling is not due to rebellion against Islam (which would contradict their adherence to Islamic prayers and jurisprudence) or because they are seen as sexual objects (which is not supported by the text). The climate of Mali making veiling impractical is also not mentioned or implied in the passage. The most plausible explanation is that the practice of not veiling is a continuation of a preexisting cultural pattern that existed before the adoption of Islam.\n\n","B","B"],["This question refers to the following information.\n\"MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.\nREMAIN NON-VIOLENT\nThe following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:\u2014\nMaulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year.

British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin.

Therefore, this option is not supported by the passage.\n\nOption B: The passage does not provide information about North Africans being captured and enslaved by rival African tribes. It focuses on the actions of the soldiers and the slave market, so this option is not supported by the passage.\n\nOption C: The passage mentions that the caravan was augmented by four hundred slaves, of whom three hundred were women. This suggests a higher number of women than men among the captured slaves, which contradicts the idea that North African tribes had more men than women due to population changes from slavery. Therefore, this option is not supported by the passage.\n\nOption D: The passage provides the prices of different categories of slaves, and it shows that young Negresses and male Negro children were valued higher than adult male slaves.
