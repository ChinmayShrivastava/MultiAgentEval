If the capacitance is 2 mF, what is the charge on the positive plate?",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We can use the formula Q = CV, where Q is the charge, C is the capacitance, and V is the potential difference. Plugging in the given values, we get Q = (2 mF)(5 V) = 0.01 C.","answer":"B"},"B"],["Which of these quantities decreases as the inverse square of distance for distances far from the objects producing the fields?",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that the electric field produced by a finite-length charged rod and an infinitely long charged cylinder decreases as the inverse distance. However, the electric field produced by an infinite plane of charge remains constant and the magnetic field produced by an infinitely long, straight current-carrying wire decreases as the inverse distance.","answer":"A"},"A"],["A solid, metal object is isolated from other charges and has charge distributed on its surface. The charge distribution is not uniform. It may be correctly concluded that the",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that the electric field inside a conductor is zero, but the electric field outside a conductor is not zero. The electric field outside the object is directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object.","answer":"C"},"D"],["Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length. The tension in the string is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced. Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that the wave speed is directly proportional to the tension in the string and inversely proportional to the wavelength. Therefore, if the tension is increased, the wave speed will increase, and the wavelength will decrease.","answer":"A"},"C"],["Two identical capacitors are hooked in parallel to an external circuit. Which of the following quantities must be the same for both capacitors? I. the charge stored on the capacitor II.  the voltage across the capacitor III. the capacitance of the capacitor",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that in a parallel circuit, the voltage across each component is the same, so option II must be true. Additionally, the capacitance of identical capacitors is the same, so option III must also be true. Therefore, the correct answer is C.","answer":"C"},"D"],["A 1-kg object is released from rest at the top of a rough-surfaced incline. The object slides without rotating to the bottom of the incline. The object\u2019s kinetic energy at the bottom must be",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that the object is sliding without rotating, so the work done by friction must be greater than the object's gain in kinetic energy. This means that the kinetic energy at the bottom must be less than the block's gravitational potential energy when it was released.","answer":"D"},"C"],["A student is experimenting with a simple spring-block oscillator of spring constant k and amplitude A. The block attached to the spring has a mass of m. If the student places a small block of mass m on top of the original block, which of the following is true?",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that the small block is most likely to slide off when the force exerted on it is at its maximum, which occurs at the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. This means that the coefficient of static friction between the blocks must be greater than the force exerted on the small block at that point, which is kA\/[(M+m)g]. Therefore, the correct answer is:","answer":"A"},"A"],["How much work is required to charge a 10 \u00b5F capacitor to a potential difference of 100 V ?",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We can use the formula W = 1\/2 * C * V^2, where W is the work done, C is the capacitance, and V is the potential difference. Plugging in the values, we get W = 1\/2 * 10 \u00b5F * (100 V)^2 = 0.05 J.","answer":"C"},"C"],["A box of mass m slides on a horizontal surface with initial speed v0. It feels no forces other than gravity and the force from the surface. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the surface is \u03bc, how far does the box slide before coming to rest?",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We can use the work-energy principle to find the distance the box slides before coming to rest.","answer":"A"},"A"],["A soccer ball, at rest on the ground, is kicked with an initial velocity of 10 m\/s at a launch angle of 30\u00b0.
