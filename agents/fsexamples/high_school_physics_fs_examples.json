Zero net external torque\nOPTIONS:\nA. I and II only\nB. I and III only\nC. II and III only\nD. III only\n\nREASONING:\n1. Identify the question and list the options:\n   - Question: Which of the following conditions will ensure that angular momentum is conserved?\n   - Options:\n     A. I and II only\n     B. I and III only\n     C. II and III only\n     D. III only\n\n2. Compare each option against the correct answer:\n   - Option A (I and II only): Conservation of linear momentum (I) is not directly related to the conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.\n   - Option B (I and III only): Conservation of linear momentum (I) is not directly related to the conservation of angular momentum. Zero net external torque (III) is the condition that ensures the conservation of angular momentum. However, this option includes conservation of linear momentum, which is not necessary for angular momentum conservation. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.\n   - Option C (II and III only): Zero net external force (II) is related to the conservation of linear momentum, not angular momentum. Zero net external torque (III) is the condition that ensures the conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, this option can be eliminated.\n   - Option D (III only): Zero net external torque (III) is the condition that ensures the conservation of angular momentum. This is the correct condition for angular momentum conservation.\n\n3. Address any potential misconceptions or common errors:\n   - One common misconception could be confusing the conservation of linear momentum with the conservation of angular momentum. It is important to understand that these are separate principles and have different conditions for conservation.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The correct answer is D. Zero net external torque (III) is the condition that will ensure that angular momentum is conserved.\n\n5. Assumptions:\n   - It is assumed that the question is specifically asking about the conservation of angular momentum, not linear momentum.\nANSWER:\nD", "Example 2:\nQUESTION:\nA pipe full of air is closed at one end.

Compare each option against the correct answer:\n   - Option A: The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode.\n     - This option is incorrect because at a closed end of a pipe, the pressure is at an antinode, not a node.\n   - Option B: The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node.\n     - This option is correct. At a closed end of a pipe, the pressure is at an antinode, and the particle displacement is at a node.\n   - Option C: The pressure and the particle displacement are both at nodes.\n     - This option is incorrect because the pressure is at an antinode, not a node, at the closed end of a pipe.\n   - Option D: The pressure and the particle displacement are both at antinodes.\n     - This option is incorrect. The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node at the closed end of a pipe.\n\n3. Address any potential misconceptions or common errors:\n   - One common misconception is that the pressure and particle displacement are always in phase. However, at a closed end of a pipe, the pressure and particle displacement are 90 degrees out of phase, leading to the correct answer being option B.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   The correct answer is B. The pressure is at an antinode, but the particle displacement is at a node at the closed end of the pipe.\nANSWER:\nB", "Example 3:\nQUESTION:\nA photocell of work function \u03d5 = 2eV is connected to a resistor in series.

Assumptions made:\n   - It is assumed that the power of the light hitting the metal plate is directly related to the current flowing through the resistor in the circuit.\nANSWER:\nD", "Example 4:\nQUESTION:\nA microwave oven is connected to an outlet, 120 V, and draws a current of 2 amps. At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\nOPTIONS:\nA. 10 W\nB. 30 W\nC. 60 W\nD. 240 W\n\nREASONING:\n1. Identify the question and list the options:\nQuestion: At what rate is energy being used by the microwave oven?\nOptions:\nA. 10 W\nB. 30 W\nC. 60 W\nD. 240 W\n\n2. Compare each option against the correct answer, explaining why each incorrect option is eliminated:\n- Option A: 10 W\nPower (P) = Voltage (V) x Current (I)\nP = 120 V x 2 A = 240 W\nSince the power calculated is 240 W, option A (10 W) is incorrect.\n\n- Option B: 30 W\nSimilar to the calculation above, the power used by the microwave oven is 240 W, not 30 W. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n- Option C: 60 W\nAgain, the actual power consumption is 240 W, not 60 W. Option C is incorrect.\n\n- Option D: 240 W\nThis option matches the calculated power consumption of the microwave oven (120 V x 2 A = 240 W). Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n\n3. Address any potential misconceptions or common errors related to the question:\nOne common error might be miscalculating the power by not multiplying the voltage and current correctly. It's important to remember that power is calculated by multiplying voltage and current.\n\n4.

How much work is required to move a charge, Q = +8 \u00b5C, from the point (0, 4 meters) to the point (3 meters, 0)?\nOPTIONS:\nA. 3.5 J\nB. 6.0 J\nC. 22.5 J\nD. 40 J\n\nREASONING:\n1. Identify the question and list the options:\n   - Question: How much work is required to move a charge from one point to another in an electric field created by a fixed point charge?\n   - Options:\n     A. 3.5 J\n     B. 6.0 J\n     C. 22.5 J\n     D. 40 J\n\n2. Compare each option against the correct answer, explaining why each incorrect option is eliminated:\n   - Option A (3.5 J): This option is too low considering the magnitude of the charges involved and the distance of the movement.\n   - Option C (22.5 J): This option is too high for the given scenario and would require a much larger charge or distance to be accurate.\n   - Option D (40 J): This option is also too high and does not align with the calculations based on the given charges and distances.\n\n3. Address any potential misconceptions or common errors related to the question:\n   - One common error might be to confuse the work done in moving a charge in an electric field with the potential energy of the charge in that field. Work is required to move a charge against the electric field, while potential energy is stored in the charge in the field.\n   - Another misconception could be miscalculating the work done by not considering the direction of the force and displacement, which are crucial in determining the work done in an electric field.\n\n4. Conclude by reiterating the correct answer after the reasoning process:\n   - The correct answer is B. 6.0 J. This option aligns with the calculations based on the given charges and distances, considering the work required to move a charge in an electric field.\n\n5. Assumptions made if the question is ambiguous or lacks context:\n   - The question assumes that the electric field created by the fixed point charge is uniform and that the movement of the charge is along a straight line between the two points specified.\nANSWER:\nB"]
