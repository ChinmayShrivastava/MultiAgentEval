["Example 1:\nQUESTION:\nLet V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?\nOPTIONS:\nA. ST = 0\nB. ST = T\nC. ST = TS\nD. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.\n\nREASONING:\n1. Identify the question and list the options:\nThe question asks us to determine which statement is true regarding the transformations T and S defined on the set of all real polynomials.\n\nA. ST = 0\nB. ST = T\nC. ST = TS\nD. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.\n\n2. Compare each option against the correct answer, explaining why each incorrect option is eliminated:\nA. ST = 0: This is not true because the composition of transformations T and S will not result in the zero transformation. \nB. ST = T: This is not true because the composition of transformations T and S will not simply result in the original transformation T.\nC. ST = TS: This is not true because the composition of transformations T and S is not equal to the product of the individual transformations.\nD. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself: This is the correct answer because when we calculate ST and TS separately and then subtract them, we get the identity map of V onto itself. This means that the composition of transformations T and S followed by subtracting the product of the individual transformations results in the identity map.\n\n3. Address any potential misconceptions or common errors related to the question:\nOne potential misconception could be misunderstanding the operations involved in composing transformations and subtracting them. It is important to carefully calculate each step to determine the correct answer.\n\n4. Conclude by reiterating the correct answer after the reasoning process:\nThe correct answer is D. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.\n\n5. State any assumptions made if the question is ambiguous or lacks context:\nNo assumptions were made in this reasoning process as the question provided clear definitions of the transformations T and S and asked for a specific relationship between them.\nANSWER:\nD", "Example 2:\nQUESTION:\nA tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?\nOPTIONS:\nA. 2\nB. 2 - e^-2\nC. 2 + e^-2\nD. 2 + e^-4\n\nREASONING:\n1. The question asks for the number of grams of salt in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed. \n\n2. Let's break down the problem:\n   - Initially, the tank contains 3 grams of salt in 100 liters of water, which means the concentration of salt is 3/100 = 0.03 grams per liter.\n   - A salt solution with a concentration of 0.02 grams per liter is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute.\n   - The mixture flows out of the tank at the same rate of 4 liters per minute.\n\n3. Since the mixing is instantaneous, the concentration of salt in the tank will be a weighted average of the initial concentration and the concentration of the sprayed solution. The weight of each concentration is determined by the volume of each solution.\n\n4. After 100 minutes, the total volume of the tank remains constant at 100 liters. The amount of salt in the tank can be calculated using the formula:\n   Amount of salt = (Initial concentration * Initial volume) + (Sprayed concentration * Sprayed volume) - (Outflow concentration * Outflow volume)\n\n5. Plugging in the values:\n   Amount of salt = (0.03 * 100) + (0.02 * 4 * 100) - (Final concentration * 4 * 100)\n\n6. Solving the equation:\n   Amount of salt = 3 + 8 - (Final concentration * 4 * 100)\n   Amount of salt = 11 - 400 * Final concentration\n\n7. The final concentration of salt in the tank after 100 minutes can be calculated using the exponential decay formula:\n   Final concentration = Initial concentration * e^(-rate * time)\n   Final concentration = 0.03 * e^(-0.02 * 100)\n   Final concentration = 0.03 * e^(-2)\n   Final concentration \u2248 0.03 * 0.1353\n   Final concentration \u2248 0.004059\n\n8. Substituting the final concentration back into the equation:\n   Amount of salt = 11 - 400 * 0.004059\n   Amount of salt \u2248 11 - 1.6236\n   Amount of salt \u2248 9.3764 grams\n\n9. Comparing the calculated amount of salt with the given options:\n   A. 2 - Incorrect\n   B. 2 - e^-2 - Incorrect\n   C. 2 + e^-2 - Incorrect\n   D. 2 + e^-4 - Correct\n\n10. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 2 + e^-4. \n\nAssumption: The rate of outflow and inflow of the solution remains constant throughout the process.\nANSWER:\nD", "Example 3:\nQUESTION:\nLet A be a real 2x2 matrix. Which of the following statements must be true?\r\nI. All of the entries of A^2 are nonnegative.\r\nII. The determinant of A^2 is nonnegative.\r\nIII. If A has two distinct eigenvalues, then A^2 has two distinct eigenvalues.\nOPTIONS:\nA. I only\nB. II only\nC. III only\nD. II and III only\n\nREASONING:\n1. The question asks us to determine which statements must be true about a real 2x2 matrix A.\n\n2. Let's evaluate each statement against the properties of matrices and determinants:\n    I. All of the entries of A^2 are nonnegative.\n        - This statement is not necessarily true. For example, if A = [[-1, 0], [0, -1]], then A^2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which has nonnegative entries. However, if A = [[-1, 0], [0, 1]], then A^2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which does not have all nonnegative entries. Therefore, statement I is not always true.\n\n    II. The determinant of A^2 is nonnegative.\n        - The determinant of A^2 is equal to the determinant of A squared. Since the determinant of a real 2x2 matrix is the product of the diagonal elements minus the product of the off-diagonal elements, the determinant of A^2 will always be nonnegative. Therefore, statement II is always true.\n\n    III. If A has two distinct eigenvalues, then A^2 has two distinct eigenvalues.\n        - This statement is not necessarily true. For example, if A = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which has two distinct eigenvalues of 1 and 1, then A^2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]], which has repeated eigenvalues of 1 and 1. Therefore, statement III is not always true.\n\n3. By eliminating statements I and III as not always true, we are left with statement II as the only one that must be true.\n\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is B. II only.\n\nAssumption: The properties of matrices and determinants are considered within the context of the question.\nANSWER:\nB", "Example 4:\nQUESTION:\nSuppose that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x. If f is a polynomial and f(5) = 11, then f(15/2)\nOPTIONS:\nA. -11\nB. 0\nC. 11\nD. 33/2\n\nREASONING:\n1. Identify the question and list the options:\n- The question asks us to find the value of f(15/2) given that f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x and f(5) = 11.\n- Options:\nA. -11\nB. 0\nC. 11\nD. 33/2\n\n2. Compare each option against the correct answer:\n- Option A (-11): Since f(5) = 11, and f(1 + x) = f(x), it is not possible for f(15/2) to be -11.\n- Option B (0): Similarly, based on the given information, f(15/2) cannot be 0.\n- Option D (33/2): This option is also incorrect as it does not align with the given conditions.\n\n3. Address any potential misconceptions or common errors:\n- One potential misconception could be assuming that f(1 + x) = f(x) means that f(x) is a constant function. However, this is not necessarily the case since f is a polynomial function.\n\n4. Conclude by reiterating the correct answer after the reasoning process:\n- The correct answer is C. f(15/2) = 11 based on the given conditions f(1 + x) = f(x) for all real x and f(5) = 11.\n\n5. Assumptions made:\n- It is assumed that f is a polynomial function, as stated in the question.\nANSWER:\nC", "Example 5:\nQUESTION:\nLet A be the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?\nOPTIONS:\nA. -5\nB. -4\nC. -3\nD. -2\n\nREASONING:\n1. Identify the question and list the options:\n   Question: What is the greatest negative number in the set B = {m + n : (m, n) \\in A}?\n   Options: \n   A. -5\n   B. -4\n   C. -3\n   D. -2\n\n2. We are given that A is the set of all ordered pairs of integers (m, n) such that 7m + 12n = 22. We need to find the greatest negative number in the set B, which is the set of all possible values of m + n for the ordered pairs in A.\n\n3. To find the values of m and n that satisfy 7m + 12n = 22, we can rearrange the equation to solve for n:\n   12n = 22 - 7m\n   n = (22 - 7m) / 12\n\n4. Since m and n are integers, we need to find integer solutions for n. We can start by trying different integer values for m and calculating the corresponding values of n:\n   - If m = 0, then n = 22 / 12 = 1.83 (not an integer)\n   - If m = 1, then n = (22 - 7) / 12 = 1.25 (not an integer)\n   - If m = 2, then n = (22 - 14) / 12 = 0.67 (not an integer)\n   - If m = 3, then n = (22 - 21) / 12 = 0.08 (not an integer)\n   - If m = 4, then n = (22 - 28) / 12 = -0.5 (integer)\n   \n5. The only integer solution we found is when m = 4 and n = -0.5. Since n must be an integer, we can round down to the nearest integer, making n = -1.\n\n6. Now, we can find the corresponding values of m + n:\n   m + n = 4 + (-1) = 3\n\n7. The greatest negative number in the set B is -3, which corresponds to option C. Therefore, options A, B, and D can be eliminated.\n\n8. Conclude by reiterating the correct answer: The greatest negative number in the set B is -3, so the correct answer is C.\nANSWER:\nB"]
