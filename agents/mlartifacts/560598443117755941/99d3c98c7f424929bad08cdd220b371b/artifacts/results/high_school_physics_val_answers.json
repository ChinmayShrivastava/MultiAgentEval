Compare each option against the correct answer:\n   - Option A (I and II only): This option states that the car will experience a greater impulse and a greater change in momentum than the truck. It is possible for the car to experience a greater impulse due to the difference in masses, but the change in momentum may not necessarily be greater. This option can be eliminated.\n   - Option B (II and III only): This option states that the car will experience a greater change in momentum and a greater acceleration than the truck. The change in momentum is related to the impulse, and the acceleration is related to the force experienced. This option is plausible and aligns with the physics of collisions.\n   - Option C (I and III only): This option states that the car will experience a greater impulse and a greater acceleration than the truck. While the car may experience a greater impulse due to the collision dynamics, the acceleration is not directly related to the impulse. This option can be eliminated.\n   - Option D (I, II, and III): This option includes all three statements. While the car may experience a greater impulse, the change in momentum and acceleration statements need to be individually evaluated. \n\n3.
