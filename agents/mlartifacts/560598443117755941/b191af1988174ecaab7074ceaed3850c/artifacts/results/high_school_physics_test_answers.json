For the net force to be zero, the magnitudes of the downward force (weight) and the upward force (normal force) must be equal. Therefore, \\( N = W \\).\n\n4.

The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step.\n   - This is not necessarily true because the change in internal energy depends on the heat added and work done in all steps, not just the isobaric step.\n\nB. The change in internal energy of the gas is equal to the work done during the isobaric step minus the work done during the isothermal step.\n   - This is not necessarily true for the same reason as option A. The internal energy change depends on the entire cycle.\n\nC. The total work done during the cycle is positive.\n   - This is not necessarily true. The total work done during the cycle could be positive, negative, or zero depending on the specific details of the process.\n\nD. The total work done during the cycle is equal but opposite to the net amount of heat transferred.\n   - This is true. For a cyclical process, the net change in internal energy is zero, so the net work done by the system must equal the net heat added to the system.

Calculate the new speed after the collision: \\( v_{\\text{new}} = 1.01 \\times v \\).\n3. Recognize that an increase in speed without a change in direction implies a transition from a circular to an elliptical orbit.\n4. Determine that the new orbit will be elliptical with the point of collision (P) as the perigee (closest point to Earth) since the speed increase occurs at this point.\n\nMissing Data:\n\n- Specific values for the gravitational constant (G), mass of Earth (M), and radius of the initial orbit (r) are not provided. However, these are not necessary to qualitatively determine the change in orbit shape.\n- Exact new orbital parameters (semi-major axis, eccentricity) are not calculable without the initial speed or radius, but the qualitative change to an elliptical orbit is clear.","1. The satellite initially orbits Earth in a circular path with constant speed. The speed for a circular orbit is given by \\( v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}} \\), where \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( M \\) is the mass of Earth, and \\( r \\) is the radius of the orbit.\n2. After the collision with the meteor at point P, the satellite's speed increases by 1%, so the new speed is \\( v_{\\text{new}} = 1.01 \\times v \\).\n3. The direction of the satellite's velocity remains unchanged, meaning the satellite's velocity vector at point P is still tangent to the original circular orbit.\n4. An increase in speed without a change in direction implies that the satellite will no longer follow a circular orbit. Instead, it will transition to an elliptical orbit.\n5. In an elliptical orbit, the point where the satellite has the highest speed (due to the conservation of angular momentum and energy) is the perigee, which is the closest point to Earth.\n6. Since the speed increase occurs at point P, point P will be the perigee of the new elliptical orbit.\n\nTherefore, the satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with point P as the closest approach to Earth.\n\n","B","B"]]}
