However, we can make some general assumptions based on the situation. When the alarm is dropped, it will experience an increase in velocity as it falls due to gravity. This increase in velocity would lead to a Doppler shift in frequency. \n\nAs the alarm falls, the frequency measured by the student would appear higher than the original 400 Hz because of the increase in velocity.
