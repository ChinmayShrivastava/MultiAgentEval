I. The car will experience a greater impulse than the truck. II. The car will experience a greater change in momentum than the truck. III. The magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the car will be greater than that experienced by the truck.","1. Impulse is directly proportional to force and time. Since the truck is heavier, it will exert a greater force on the car during the collision, resulting in the car experiencing a greater impulse.\n2. Change in momentum is directly proportional to mass and change in velocity. The heavier truck will experience a smaller change in velocity compared to the lighter car due to the collision.\n3. Acceleration is inversely proportional to time. Since the truck will experience a smaller change in velocity, the magnitude of acceleration experienced by the car will be greater than that experienced by the truck.\n\n","A","C"],["A light bulb rated at 100 W is twice as bright as a bulb rated at 50 W when both are connected in parallel directly to a 100-V source. Now imagine that these bulbs are instead connected in series with each other. Which is brighter, and by how much?","1. Calculate the current flowing through the bulbs in series:\nTotal Resistance (R_total) = R1 + R2\nResistance of first bulb (R1) = V^2 \/ P1 = 100^2 \/ 100 = 100 ohms\nResistance of second bulb (R2) = V^2 \/ P2 = 100^2 \/ 50 = 200 ohms\nTotal Resistance (R_total) = 100 + 200 = 300 ohms\nCurrent (I) = V \/ R_total = 100 \/ 300 = 1\/3 A\n\n2. Calculate the power dissipated by each bulb:\nPower of first bulb = V^2 \/ R1 = 100^2 \/ 100 = 100 W\nPower of second bulb = V^2 \/ R2 = 100^2 \/ 200 = 50 W\n\n","C","C"],["You have a wire of length L, radius Q, and resistance Q. You need to obtain half that resistance using the same material and changing only one factor. You could","1. The resistance of a wire is given by the formula R = \u03c1 * (L\/A), where \u03c1 is resistivity, L is length, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n2. To halve the resistance, we need to halve the value of R.\n3. Since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area, halving the resistance means doubling the cross-sectional area.\n4. The cross-sectional area of a wire is proportional to the square of its radius (A = \u03c0 * r^2).\n5. Therefore, to double the cross-sectional area, we need to use twice the radius.\n\n","D","A"],["A swimmer is able to propel himself forward through the water by moving his arms. Which of the following correctly states the applicant and recipient of the force responsible for the swimmer\u2019s forward acceleration?","The swimmer applies a force with his arms to the surrounding water, making the force of the swimmer's arms on the surrounding water the applicant. In return, the surrounding water exerts an equal and opposite force on the swimmer, making the force of the surrounding water on the swimmer's arms the recipient. This recipient force from the water is responsible for propelling the swimmer forward.\n\n","C","A"],["A spherical balloon filled with helium is floating in air. If the balloon is inflated until its radius is doubled, how will the buoyant force on the balloon be affected?","1. The initial volume of the balloon can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * r^3.\n2. When the radius is doubled, the final volume of the balloon becomes V' = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * (2r)^3 = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * 8r^3 = 8 * (4\/3) * \u03c0 * r^3 = 8V.\n3. The change in volume is V' - V = 8V - V = 7V.\n4. The buoyant force is directly proportional to the volume of the balloon, so when the volume increases by a factor of 7, the buoyant force will also increase by the same factor.\n\n","C","C"],["An object initially at rest experiences a time-varying acceleration given by a = (2 m\/s^3)t for t \u2265 0. How far does the object travel in the first 3 seconds?","The acceleration of the object is given by a = (2 m\/s^3)t. To find the distance traveled in the first 3 seconds, we need to calculate the acceleration at t = 3 seconds, which is a = (2 m\/s^3) * 3 s = 6 m\/s^2. Then, we can substitute the values into the formula for distance traveled: s = ut + 0.5 * a * t^2. Plugging in u = 0 m\/s, a = 6 m\/s^2, and t = 3 seconds, we get s = 0 * 3 + 0.5 * 6 * 3^2 = 27 m.\n\n","C","A"],["A pair of protective headphones reduces the sound of a jet engine from 140 dB to 110 dB.

The gases are initially at a temperature of 300 K when the container is placed in an oven and brought to a new equilibrium temperature of 600 K. Which of the following best describes what is happening to the molecular speeds and kinetic energies of the gases\u2019 molecules as they move from 300 K to 600 K?","As the temperature of the gases increases from 300 K to 600 K, both hydrogen and carbon dioxide molecules will experience an increase in their molecular speeds and kinetic energies. This is because the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule is directly proportional to its temperature, and the root mean square speed of a gas molecule is directly proportional to the square root of its temperature. Since both gases are at the same temperature, they will both speed up and gain kinetic energy proportionally to the temperature change.\n\n","B","B"],["A uniform bar is lying on a flat table. Besides the gravitational and normal forces (which cancel), the bar is acted upon by two other forces, F1 and F2, which are parallel to the surface of the table. If the net force on the rod is zero, then which one of the following is true?","Since the net force on the bar is zero, we know that F1 + F2 = 0. This implies that F1 = -F2, meaning that the forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. When forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they create a couple, which results in a net torque. Therefore, the correct statement is that the net torque on the bar must also be zero.\n\n","A","C"],["An arrow is aimed horizontally, directly at the center of a target 20 m away.

Work is defined as force multiplied by distance. Force is defined as mass multiplied by acceleration. Therefore, power can be expressed as (mass * acceleration * distance) \/ time. Since acceleration is distance divided by time squared, the dimensions of power can be represented as (mass * distance^2) \/ time^3.\n\n","C","D"],["A projectile is launched on level ground in a parabolic path so that its range would normally be 500 m. When the projectile is at the peak of its flight, the projectile breaks into two pieces of equal mass. One of these pieces falls straight down, with no further horizontal motion. How far away from the launch point does the other piece land?","1. Given range = 500 m\n2. Range formula: Range = (initial velocity)^2 * sin(2*launch angle) \/ acceleration due to gravity\n3. Since the projectile breaks into two pieces of equal mass at the peak, the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile to the peak is half of the total range.\n4. Therefore, the horizontal distance to the peak = 500 m \/ 2 = 250 m\n5. The second piece lands at a distance equal to the total range minus the distance fallen by the first piece.\n6. The first piece falls straight down, so the distance fallen by the first piece is 0.\n7. The total range is 500 m.\n8. Therefore, the distance where the second piece lands = 500 m - 0 = 500 m\n\n","C","D"],["In the laboratory, a cart experiences a single horizontal force as it moves horizontally in a straight line. Of the following data collected about this experiment, which is sufficient to determine the work done on the cart by the horizontal force?","To determine the work done on the cart by the horizontal force, we need to consider the formula: Work = Force * Distance * cos(angle). The data required to calculate the work done includes the magnitude of the force, the distance the cart moves horizontally, and the angle between the force and the direction of motion. Without the angle information, we cannot accurately determine the work done.\n\n","A","C"],["It is observed that sounds can be heard around a corner but that light cannot be seen around a corner. What is a reasonable explanation for this observation?","1. Sounds are waves that can diffract around obstacles due to their longer wavelengths, allowing them to bend and reach the listener even around corners.\n2. Light, being an electromagnetic wave, travels in straight lines and does not diffract as easily as sound, which is why it cannot be seen around corners.\n\n","B","B"],["A spherical conductor carries a net charge.
