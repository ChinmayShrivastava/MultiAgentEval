I. The car will experience a greater impulse than the truck. II. The car will experience a greater change in momentum than the truck. III. The magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the car will be greater than that experienced by the truck.","1. Impulse is directly proportional to force and time. Since the heavier toy truck will exert a greater force due to its mass, the car will experience a greater impulse.\n2. Change in momentum is directly proportional to mass and change in velocity. The heavier toy truck will have a greater mass, resulting in a smaller change in velocity compared to the lightweight car.\n3. Acceleration is inversely proportional to time. Since the collision is head-on, the change in velocity will be more sudden for the car, resulting in a greater acceleration.\n\n","A","C"],["A light bulb rated at 100 W is twice as bright as a bulb rated at 50 W when both are connected in parallel directly to a 100-V source. Now imagine that these bulbs are instead connected in series with each other. Which is brighter, and by how much?","1. Calculate the current flowing through the bulbs in parallel:\nFor the 100 W bulb:\nP1 = V * I1\n100 = 100 * I1\nI1 = 1 A\n\nFor the 50 W bulb:\nP2 = V * I2\n50 = 100 * I2\nI2 = 0.5 A\n\n2.

You need to obtain half that resistance using the same material and changing only one factor. You could","1. The resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area.\n2. To halve the resistance, we need to either decrease the length or increase the cross-sectional area (radius) of the wire.\n3. Since we are required to change only one factor, we should focus on either the length or the radius.\n\n","C","A"],["A swimmer is able to propel himself forward through the water by moving his arms. Which of the following correctly states the applicant and recipient of the force responsible for the swimmer\u2019s forward acceleration?","The swimmer's arms apply a force to the surrounding water, which acts as the recipient of the force.

If the balloon is inflated until its radius is doubled, how will the buoyant force on the balloon be affected?","1. The initial volume of the balloon can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * r^3.\n2. When the radius is doubled, the final volume of the balloon becomes V' = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * (2r)^3 = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * 8r^3 = 8 * (4\/3) * \u03c0 * r^3 = 8V.\n3. The change in volume is V' - V = 8V - V = 7V.\n4. The buoyant force is directly proportional to the volume of the balloon, so when the volume increases by a factor of 7, the buoyant force will increase by the same factor.\n\n","C","C"],["An object initially at rest experiences a time-varying acceleration given by a = (2 m\/s^3)t for t \u2265 0.

Which of the following best describes what is happening to the molecular speeds and kinetic energies of the gases\u2019 molecules as they move from 300 K to 600 K?","1. The average speed of gas molecules is directly proportional to the square root of the temperature.\n2. As the temperature doubles from 300 K to 600 K, the average speed of the molecules will increase by a factor of sqrt(2).\n3. The kinetic energy of a gas molecule is directly proportional to the square of its speed.\n\nGiven that the number of hydrogen and carbon dioxide molecules is equal, we can compare the changes in average speed and kinetic energy for both gases.\n\n","C","B"],["A uniform bar is lying on a flat table. Besides the gravitational and normal forces (which cancel), the bar is acted upon by two other forces, F1 and F2, which are parallel to the surface of the table. If the net force on the rod is zero, then which one of the following is true?","If the net force on the bar is zero, then F1 + F2 = 0. This implies that F1 = -F2 or F2 = -F1. Therefore, the forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. When two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction and act at different points on the bar, they create a net torque. However, if F1 and F2 are applied at the same point, they will not create a net torque.\n\n","C","C"],["An arrow is aimed horizontally, directly at the center of a target 20 m away.

What is a reasonable explanation for this observation?","Sound waves have longer wavelengths compared to light waves, which allows them to diffract or bend around obstacles such as corners. This diffraction property of sound waves enables them to be heard around corners. On the other hand, light waves have shorter wavelengths, making them less prone to diffraction, which is why light cannot be seen around corners.\n\n","B","B"],["A spherical conductor carries a net charge.
