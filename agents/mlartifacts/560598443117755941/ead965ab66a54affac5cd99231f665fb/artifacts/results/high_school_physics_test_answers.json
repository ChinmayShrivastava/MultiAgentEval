The orbital period of Mercury is given as 1\/5 of an Earth year.\n2. The orbital period formula is T = \u221a(a^3), where T is the orbital period and a is the distance between the planet and the sun.\n3. Since Mercury's orbital period is 1\/5 of an Earth year, we can substitute T = 1\/5 in the formula.\n4. Solving for a, we get a = \u221b(T^2) = \u221b((1\/5)^2) = \u221b(1\/25) = 1\/5.\n\n","A","D"],["The Gravitron is a carnival ride that looks like a large cylinder.
