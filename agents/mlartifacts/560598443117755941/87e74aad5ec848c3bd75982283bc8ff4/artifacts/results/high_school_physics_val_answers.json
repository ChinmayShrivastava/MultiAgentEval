Compare each option against the correct answer:\n   - Since the options are not visible, we cannot compare them directly. However, we can reason based on the question.\n   - The work done by the centripetal force is given by the formula: Wc = 2\u03c0Rmv, where R is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, m is the Earth's mass, and v is the tangential speed.\n   - In one year, the Earth completes one revolution around the Sun, so the work done by the centripetal force in one year would be the total work done in one revolution multiplied by the number of revolutions in a year.\n\n3. Address any potential misconceptions or common errors:\n   - One common error could be misunderstanding the relationship between centripetal force, work, and circular motion. It is essential to recognize that centripetal force provides the necessary acceleration for an object to move in a circular path.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The work done by the centripetal force in one year can be calculated based on the given information about the Earth's motion around the Sun.\n\n","B","C"]]}
