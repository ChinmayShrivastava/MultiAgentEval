Statement 2 | Every group is isomorphic to some group of permutations.","1. The symmetric group S_3 is not cyclic because it does not have a single generator that can generate all its elements.\n2. Every group is isomorphic to some group of permutations, which means that any group can be represented as a group of permutations of its elements.\nTherefore, Statement 1 is False and Statement 2 is True.\n","D","D"],["Statement 1 | If a and b are elements of finite order in an Abelian group, then |ab| is the lcm (|a|,|b|). Statement 2 | If g is a group element and g^n = e, then |g| = n.","1. Statement 1 is true in an Abelian group because the order of the product of two elements is the least common multiple of their individual orders.\n2. Statement 2 is also true because in a group, if an element raised to a power equals the identity element, then the order of that element is equal to the power.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.

Statement 1 states that if f is a homomorphism from G to K and H is normal in G, then f(H) is normal in K. This is a true property of homomorphisms and normal subgroups.\n2. Statement 2 states that if f is a homomorphism from G to a group and H is a finite subgroup of G, then |f(H)| divides |H|. This is also a true property of homomorphisms and finite subgroups.\n\nTherefore, both statements are true.\n\n","A","D"],["Find the maximum possible order for an element of S_n for n = 7.","In S_7, the maximum possible order for an element is determined by the LCM of the cycle lengths in its cycle decomposition. The cycle decomposition of elements in S_7 can have cycles of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. To maximize the order, we need to consider the LCM of all these possible cycle lengths.\n\n","C","B"],["Statement 1 | Every integral domain has a field of quotients.

An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity where every nonzero element is a non-zero divisor. A field of quotients of an integral domain is a field that contains the integral domain and in which every element of the integral domain has a multiplicative inverse.\n2. The statement that every integral domain has a field of quotients is true.\n3. The degree of a polynomial over a ring is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.\n4. The statement that a polynomial of degree n over a ring can have at most n zeros counting multiplicity is false. For example, a polynomial of degree 2 can have 2 zeros, but it can also have fewer than 2 zeros.\n\n","C","C"],["Statement 1 | If a group has an element of order 10, then the number of elements of order 10 is divisible by 4. Statement 2 | If m and n are positive integers and phi is the Euler phi function, then phi(mn) = phi(m)phi(n).","1. Statement 1: In a group, if an element has an order of 10, it means that the subgroup generated by that element has 10 elements. The number of elements of order 10 in a group is equal to the number of elements in the group that generate subgroups of order 10. Since the order of an element divides the order of the group, the number of elements of order 10 must be divisible by the order of the subgroup generated by the element, which is 10. Therefore, the number of elements of order 10 in a group is divisible by 10. However, the statement claims it is divisible by 4, which is incorrect. Hence, Statement 1 is False.\n\n2. Statement 2: The Euler phi function phi(n) gives the number of positive integers less than n that are coprime to n. For two positive integers m and n, the Euler phi function of their product mn is equal to phi(m) * phi(n). This property holds true for the Euler phi function. Therefore, Statement 2 is True.\n\n","C","B"]]}
