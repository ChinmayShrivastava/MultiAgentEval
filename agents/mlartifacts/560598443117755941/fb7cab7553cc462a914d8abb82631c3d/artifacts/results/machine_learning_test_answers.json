The derivative of the sigmoid function $\\sigma(x) = (1 + e^{-x})^{-1}$ with respect to $x$ can be calculated using the chain rule as $\\sigma'(x) = e^{-x}(1 + e^{-x})^{-2}$.\n2. The Bernoulli random variable $B \\sim \\text{Bern}(\\sigma(x))$ means that $B$ takes the value 1 with probability $\\sigma(x)$ and 0 with probability $1-\\sigma(x)$.\n3. Setting the bias parameters in each layer of a neural network to 0 would affect the bias-variance trade-off. When biases are set to 0, the model's variance increases because the model becomes more flexible and can fit the training data more closely. However, the model's bias decreases because it becomes less likely to underfit the data.\n\n","C","C"]]}
