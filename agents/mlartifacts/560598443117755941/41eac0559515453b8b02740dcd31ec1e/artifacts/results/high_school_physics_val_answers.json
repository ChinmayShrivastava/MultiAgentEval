I. The car will experience a greater impulse than the truck. II. The car will experience a greater change in momentum than the truck. III. The magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the car will be greater than that experienced by the truck.","1. The lightweight toy car will experience a greater force during the collision due to the impact with the heavier toy truck.\n2. Since impulse is directly proportional to force and time, the car will experience a greater impulse than the truck.\n3. The change in momentum is directly proportional to mass and change in velocity. The heavier truck will have a smaller change in velocity compared to the lighter car, resulting in the car experiencing a greater change in momentum.\n4. Acceleration is inversely proportional to mass and directly proportional to change in velocity. The car, being lighter, will have a greater acceleration compared to the truck.\n\n","A","C"],["A light bulb rated at 100 W is twice as bright as a bulb rated at 50 W when both are connected in parallel directly to a 100-V source. Now imagine that these bulbs are instead connected in series with each other. Which is brighter, and by how much?","1. Calculate the current flowing through each bulb in parallel:\n   - For the 100 W bulb: I1 = P1 \/ V = 100 W \/ 100 V = 1 A\n   - For the 50 W bulb: I2 = P2 \/ V = 50 W \/ 100 V = 0.5 A\n\n2. Calculate the resistance of each bulb in parallel:\n   - For the 100 W bulb: R1 = V\u00b2 \/ P1 = 100 V\u00b2 \/ 100 W = 100 ohms\n   - For the 50 W bulb: R2 = V\u00b2 \/ P2 = 100 V\u00b2 \/ 50 W = 200 ohms\n\n3.

You need to obtain half that resistance using the same material and changing only one factor. You could","1. The resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area.\n2. To reduce the resistance by half, we need to either double the cross-sectional area or halve the length of the wire.\n3. Since we are changing only one factor, we cannot double the cross-sectional area, so we must halve the length of the wire.\n\n","A","A"],["A swimmer is able to propel himself forward through the water by moving his arms. Which of the following correctly states the applicant and recipient of the force responsible for the swimmer\u2019s forward acceleration?","The swimmer propels himself forward by moving his arms, which means the applicant of the force is the swimmer's arms. According to Newton's third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Therefore, the recipient of the force responsible for the swimmer's forward acceleration is the surrounding water, which exerts a reaction force on the swimmer's arms.\n","C","A"],["A spherical balloon filled with helium is floating in air. If the balloon is inflated until its radius is doubled, how will the buoyant force on the balloon be affected?","1. The initial volume of the balloon can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a sphere: V = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * r^3.\n2. When the radius is doubled, the final volume of the balloon becomes V' = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * (2r)^3 = (4\/3) * \u03c0 * 8r^3 = 8 * (4\/3) * \u03c0 * r^3 = 8V.\n3. Comparing the initial volume (V) and the final volume (8V), we see that the final volume is 8 times the initial volume.\n4. Since the buoyant force is directly proportional to the volume of the balloon, when the volume increases by a factor of 8, the buoyant force will also increase by a factor of 8.\n\n","C","C"],["An object initially at rest experiences a time-varying acceleration given by a = (2 m\/s^3)t for t \u2265 0.

Which of the following best describes what is happening to the molecular speeds and kinetic energies of the gases\u2019 molecules as they move from 300 K to 600 K?","1. The kinetic energy of a gas molecule is directly proportional to its temperature.\n2. The average kinetic energy of gas molecules is related to the temperature through the formula KE_avg = (3\/2) * k * T, where k is the Boltzmann constant.\n3. The root mean square speed of gas molecules is related to the temperature through the formula v_rms = sqrt((3 * k * T) \/ m), where m is the molar mass of the gas molecule.\n\nGiven that the initial and final temperatures are provided, we can calculate the initial and final kinetic energies, as well as the initial and final root mean square speeds for both hydrogen and carbon dioxide molecules. By comparing these values, we can determine how the molecular speeds and kinetic energies change as the gases move from 300 K to 600 K.\n\n","C","B"],["A uniform bar is lying on a flat table. Besides the gravitational and normal forces (which cancel), the bar is acted upon by two other forces, F1 and F2, which are parallel to the surface of the table. If the net force on the rod is zero, then which one of the following is true?","Since the net force on the bar is zero, we know that F1 + F2 = 0. This implies that F1 = -F2 or F2 = -F1. Therefore, the relationship between the forces F1 and F2 is that they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. When forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, they create a couple or torque that tends to rotate the bar. Therefore, the correct statement is that the net torque on the bar must also be zero.\n\n","A","C"],["An arrow is aimed horizontally, directly at the center of a target 20 m away.

Of the following data collected about this experiment, which is sufficient to determine the work done on the cart by the horizontal force?","To determine the work done on the cart by the horizontal force, we need to consider the formula for work, which includes the force applied, the distance moved, and the angle between the force and the direction of motion. However, the mass of the cart is also a crucial factor in calculating work done.

What is a reasonable explanation for this observation?","Sound waves have longer wavelengths compared to light waves, which allows them to diffract or bend around obstacles. This property enables sound to be heard around corners. On the other hand, light waves have shorter wavelengths and do not diffract as easily, leading to the inability to see light around corners.\n\n","B","B"],["A spherical conductor carries a net charge. How is this charge distributed on the sphere?","The charge on a spherical conductor will distribute uniformly on the surface due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. The charge resides on the outer surface of the conductor, with no charge inside the sphere.

Assuming that the deceleration due to the brakes is constant, what would be the skidding distance of the same car if it were traveling with twice the initial speed?","1. In the first scenario, the initial speed is v0, and the braking distance is x. Using the equation of motion v^2 = u^2 + 2as, where v is the final speed (0 m\/s since the car stops), u is the initial speed (v0), a is the deceleration, and s is the braking distance, we get v0^2 = 0 + 2a*x.\n2. Solving for the deceleration (a) in terms of v0 and x, we get a = v0^2 \/ (2x).\n3. In the second scenario, the initial speed is 2v0, and we need to find the skidding distance. Using the same equation of motion, we get (2v0)^2 = v0^2 + 2a*s2, where s2 is the skidding distance we want to find.\n4. Substituting the deceleration value calculated earlier, we get 4v0^2 = v0^2 + 2(v0^2 \/ (2x)) * s2.\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get 4v0^2 = v0^2 + v0^2 * s2 \/ x.\n6.
