Reasoning: Taking into account the information provided, the plausible approaches to dealing with residual autocorrelation are i) Take logarithms of each of the variables, ii) Add lagged values of the variables to the regression equation, and iv) Try a model in first differenced form rather than in levels. Therefore, the correct answer is A. (ii) and (iv) only.
Answer: A
------------------------
36. ------------------------
Reasoning: The roots of the characteristic equation must all lie inside the unit circle for an autoregressive process to be considered stationary. This is because having roots inside the unit circle ensures that the process is stable and does not exhibit explosive behavior, which is a key characteristic of stationarity.
Answer: A
------------------------
37. ------------------------
Reasoning: Adjusted R-squared is a commonly used metric in model evaluation that penalizes for the number of predictors in the model, making it a form of information criterion. It helps to assess the goodness of fit of a model by taking into account the number of predictors used, which is a key aspect of information criteria. Therefore, the statement that adjusted R-squared is an information criterion is true. When the residual sum of squares falls with the addition of a new term, it indicates a better fit of the model, leading to a decrease in the information criterion value. Akaike's information criterion always selects model orders that are at least as large as Schwarz's information criterion due to its lesser penalty for model complexity. Akaike's information criterion is consistent, ensuring the selection of the true model as the sample size increases.

Reasoning: The statement that the standardised residuals from an estimated GARCH model are assumed to be normally distributed is true because in GARCH models, it is typically assumed that the standardized residuals follow a normal distribution. The statement that their squares will be related to their lagged squared values if the GARCH model is appropriate is also true. In practice, the standardised residuals are likely to have fat tails due to the nature of financial data. However, the statement that the standardised residuals and raw residuals will be identical if the GARCH model is adequate is false.
Answer: D

Answer: C
------------------------
55. ------------------------
Reasoning: The consequences of omitting a relevant variable from a regression equation would lead to biased standard errors, inconsistent slope coefficients, and an inconsistent intercept coefficient.

63. ------------------------
Reasoning: The assumptions required to show the consistency, unbiasedness, and efficiency of the OLS estimator are i) $E(u_t) = 0$, ii) $\text{Var}(u_t) = \sigma^2$, and iii) $\text{Cov}(u_t, u_{t-j}) = 0 \forall j. These assumptions are fundamental for the OLS estimator to exhibit the desired properties. The assumption that the error term follows a normal distribution, $u_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, is not directly related to these properties.
Answer: C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only

Reasoning: The unrestricted residual sum of squares should be minimized to allow the model to freely estimate parameters and provide the best fit to the data in testing for structural stability.
Answer: A
------------------------
83. ------------------------
Reasoning: The likelihood ratio test statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the restricted and unrestricted models. In this case, since we are testing if a GARCH(2,2) model can be restricted to a process with a constant conditional variance, the degrees of freedom would be 2. Therefore, the correct statement is that the test statistic will follow a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis.
Answer: A

91. Reasoning: When the number of replications used in a Monte Carlo study is small, the results may not accurately represent the true population parameters due to limited sample size. This can lead to imprecise estimation of the statistic of interest and larger standard errors. Additionally, with a small number of replications, there is a higher chance of obtaining unrepresentative combinations of random draws, further affecting the accuracy of the results. However, variance reduction techniques can help mitigate these issues by improving the precision of the estimates and reducing the standard errors.
Answer: C
92. ------------------------
Reasoning: The random effects approach assumes that the unobserved individual effects are uncorrelated with the observed independent variables, which can lead to biased and inconsistent estimates if this assumption is violated. This is a significant disadvantage of the random effects approach in estimating a panel model.
Answer: A
------------------------
93. ------------------------
Reasoning: Autocorrelated residuals can occur due to slowness of response of the dependent variable to changes in the values of the independent variables, over-reactions of the dependent variable to changes in the independent variables, and omission of relevant explanatory variables that are autocorrelated. Outliers in the data may not necessarily lead to autocorrelated residuals.
Answer: C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only

Reasoning: The advantages of the use of panel data over pure cross-sectional or pure time-series modeling lie in its ability to capture variations in the dependent variable across both cross-sectional and time dimensions, providing a more robust and comprehensive analysis.
Answer: D

Reasoning: The null hypothesis in the Engle-Granger test applied to the residuals of a potentially cointegrating regression is that there is no cointegration between the variables being tested, as the test is used to determine if a long-term relationship exists between the variables.
Answer: B
------------------------
114. Reasoning: The acf and pacf are different concepts, so statement i is false. The pacf for an MA(q) model will be non-zero beyond lag q, making statement ii true. The pacf for an AR(p) model will be zero beyond lag p, making statement iii true. The acf and pacf will be the same at lag two for an MA(1) model, making statement iv true.
Answer: D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)
