Reasoning: The force exerted on the block by the table is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the frictional force experienced by the block due to Newton's third law of motion.
Answer: B
------------------------
115. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should involve the interaction between charged particles, such as electrons, because electromagnetic force is responsible for the interaction between objects with electric charge. In this case, the wooden block and the table are made up of atoms with electrons, which have negative charges. The electromagnetic force between these charged particles is what keeps the wooden block supported on the tabletop.

Reasoning: External factors such as air resistance or imperfections in the surface can introduce variability in the toy's movement up the ramp. Air resistance can slow down the toy's movement, while imperfections in the surface can cause the toy to encounter different levels of friction as it rolls. This variability in external factors can lead to the toy ending up at different heights on the ramp in different trials, even though the same kinetic energy is imparted to the cart each time. Therefore, addressing the potential influence of these external factors is a reasonable explanation for the phenomenon observed.
Answer: D

Reasoning: The gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. As the distance between the Earth and the Moon is significant, the gravitational force should decrease. Therefore, the best estimate of the gravitational force of the Earth on the Moon would be 10^19 N.

Reasoning: The percentage of the object's volume above the surface of the water is equal to the ratio of the volume of the object to the volume of water displaced, multiplied by 100%. Since the volume of water displaced is equal to the volume of the object when it floats, the percentage is 100%. 
Answer: A
------------------------
122. ------------------------
Reasoning: The acceleration of the object can be determined by taking the second derivative of the position equation with respect to time. The coefficient of the t^3 term (2.0) represents the acceleration component of the object's motion. By plugging in t = 1.50 s into the second derivative of the position equation, we can find the acceleration at that specific time.
Answer: A. 6 m/s^2

Reasoning: The car starts from rest, so the initial velocity is 0 m/s. With an acceleration of 5 m/s^2, the time taken to cover the distance can be calculated using the formula t = (v - u) / a, where v is the final velocity, u is the initial velocity, and a is the acceleration. Since the final velocity is not given, we can use the formula v^2 = u^2 + 2as to find it. Substituting the values, we get v = 20 m/s. Plugging these values into the time formula, we get t = (20 - 0) / 5 = 4 s.
Answer: A

125. ------------------------
Reasoning: The vector sum of all torques on the object must equal zero to prevent rotation, and the vector sum of all forces on the object must equal zero to maintain its stationary position. Both conditions are necessary for an object to be in static equilibrium, especially when considering objects with varying characteristics.

Reasoning: Using a smaller test charge like experimenter A with charge qo leads to a more accurate measurement of the electric field between the parallel plates due to less distortion caused by the presence of the charge itself.
Answer: C
------------------------
128. ------------------------
Reasoning: When halving the mass of Object A, the gravitational force between Object A and Object B will also be halved. In order to maintain equilibrium, the distance between the two objects needs to be halved as well. This is because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects, so reducing the distance by half will result in the gravitational force being doubled, balancing out the halved mass of Object A.
Answer: A

Reasoning: The total speed of the stone when it enters the water can be calculated by combining the horizontal component of 30 m/s (which remains constant) with the vertical component influenced by gravity. The vertical distance fallen can be calculated using d = 0.5 * g * t^2, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2) and t is the time (4 seconds). By combining these components, the total speed can be determined.
Answer: D
------------------------
133. ------------------------
Reasoning: The force of gravitational attraction is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the objects, so if the mass of each object is doubled, the force will quadruple. Additionally, when the distance between the centers of the objects is doubled, the force decreases. 
Answer: B

Reasoning: The formula to calculate current drawn by an electrical device is I = P/V, where I is the current, P is the power rating of the device (60 W in this case), and V is the voltage at which it operates (120 V). By substituting the values into the formula, we get I = 60 W / 120 V = 0.5 A.

Reasoning: The force experienced by a charged particle moving through a magnetic field is directly proportional to the charge, velocity, and the sine of the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field. Doubling the charge, mass, and velocity of the particles would result in a force that is also doubled.
Answer: B

Reasoning: The electric force between two charged particles is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Given that particle A has a net charge of 2Q and particle B has a net charge of Q, and they are 4m apart, the ratio of the magnitude of the electric force on A to that on B can be calculated using the charges and distance.

Reasoning: The decrease in amplitude of the wave as it travels from the point of impact to the shore indicates a loss of energy due to factors such as friction with the water and the shore. This decrease in amplitude results in the portion of the wave hitting the child's ankles carrying less energy than when it was first created by the rock's impact.

150. ------------------------
Reasoning: The greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride is directly proportional to the coefficient of friction (μ) and the square of the tangential speed (v), and inversely proportional to the radius (R) because the centripetal force required to keep a person from falling is provided by the frictional force between the person's clothing and the wall, which is dependent on the coefficient of friction and the square of the tangential speed. Additionally, the centripetal force is inversely proportional to the radius of the ride, as a larger radius requires less force to keep a person from falling.
