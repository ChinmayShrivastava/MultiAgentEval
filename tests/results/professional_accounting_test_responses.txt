Reasoning: The NPV of the investment project can be calculated by discounting the future cash flows back to the present value using the formula. Given that the project costs $500 today and generates profits of $500 in year five and year ten, the present value of these cash flows at a 10% discount rate would be $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 + $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10. Calculating this results in a total present value of approximately $248.69. Therefore, the NPV of the project would be $248.69 - $500 = -$251.31, which is closest to option B. 
Answer: B

Reasoning: The total cost per unit for Spark Co. includes the purchase price of $125, sales commission of $25 per phone sold, and fixed costs of $3000. This totals to $150 per unit. 
------------------------
Reasoning: The revenue generated per unit sold at the selling price of $200 is $175 ($200 - $25 commission). 
------------------------
Reasoning: The profit margin per unit should be 20% because Spark Co. desires a profit of 10% of sales, which means the profit margin per unit should be double that percentage.
------------------------
Reasoning: To calculate the number of units Spark Co. must sell to achieve the desired profit margin of 10%, we divide the total fixed costs and desired profit by the profit margin per unit. This gives us 400 units.

135. ------------------------
Reasoning: The amortization expense should be calculated based on the cost of the copyright divided by its legal life, which is the life of the author plus 50 years. Since the author's life is not provided, we can assume a reasonable estimate for the author's remaining life. Therefore, the annual amortization expense would be $20,000 / (Author's remaining life + 50 years). 
Answer: B
------------------------
136. ------------------------
Reasoning: The gain recognized by the shareholder should be $2,000 because it is calculated as the fair market value of the equipment ($20,000) minus the basis ($6,000) minus the liability assumed ($12,000), resulting in a gain of $2,000.
Answer: C
------------------------
137. ------------------------
Reasoning: Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. Current assets for Carter Co. include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and inventories, totaling $1,300,000. Non-current assets like patent and equipment are not included. Current liabilities amount to $640,000.

Answer: C
------------------------
138. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should be based on the principle of negligence because it is a fundamental legal concept that holds individuals, including CPAs, accountable for their actions when they fail to exercise reasonable care in a given situation. Negligence involves a breach of the duty of care owed to others, which can result in liability to third parties who suffer harm as a result of the negligent actions. Therefore, when a CPA recklessly departs from the standards of due care during an audit, they may be held liable to third parties who are unknown to them under the principle of negligence.
Answer: C

Using the formula for contribution margin percentage, the correct answer can be determined to be $12.80.
Answer: B
------------------------
151. ------------------------
Reasoning: Errors in ending inventory and depreciation expense directly impact the calculation of pretax income. An overstatement of ending inventory will result in lower pretax income, while an understatement of depreciation expense will result in higher pretax income. Therefore, the correct pretax income should be adjusted by deducting the ending inventory overstatement and adding back the depreciation expense understatement.
Answer: B

Reasoning: Improving inventory turnover from 5 times to 8 times means the firm is selling inventory more quickly, releasing funds that were tied up in inventory. The difference in funds released can be calculated by multiplying the change in turnover (8 - 5 = 3) by the initial COGS ($800,000). Therefore, $240,000 is released, not invested additionally.
Answer: A
------------------------
157. ------------------------
Reasoning: The statement "Management is responsible for making all financial records and related information available to us" aligns with the responsibility of the client to provide access to necessary information for the audit process, which is a common inclusion in an auditor's engagement letter.

Reasoning: To calculate the break-even point, we need to consider the contribution margin per unit of DVD players, which is $40. The total contribution margin needed to cover the fixed costs of $90000 can be calculated by dividing the fixed costs by the contribution margin per unit, resulting in 2250 units. However, since the sales mix estimate is one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold, we need to adjust the number of DVD players needed to break even. For every one home entertainment system sold, the company sells four DVD players. Therefore, to break even, the company needs to sell 2250 DVD players multiplied by 4, which equals 9000 DVD players.
