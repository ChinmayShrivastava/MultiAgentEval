Reasoning: To calculate the probability of a patient being diagnosed with at least one of the conditions, we need to consider both scenarios where the patient is diagnosed with Condition A and where the patient is not diagnosed with Condition A. The probability of being diagnosed with Condition A is 15%, and if diagnosed with Condition A, the probability of also being diagnosed with Condition B is 70%. If not diagnosed with Condition A, the probability of being diagnosed with Condition B is 10%. Therefore, the overall probability can be calculated as 15% (diagnosed with A and B) + 85% (not diagnosed with A) * 10% (diagnosed with B) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.10 = 0.235.

Reasoning: The expected value of the sum of two random variables X + Y is equal to E(X) + E(Y), which is 312 + 307 = 619. The variance of the sum of two random variables X + Y is equal to var(X) + var(Y), which is 6 + 8 = 14.
Answer: C
------------------------
206. ------------------------
Reasoning: The false statement would involve an element that is not present in both sets X and Y. The element 35 is present in set Y but not in set X, making it the false statement.
Answer: C

Reasoning: In a well-designed, well-conducted sample survey, sampling error is effectively eliminated is a true statement because a well-designed survey aims to minimize sampling error through proper sampling techniques and methodologies.
Answer: A
------------------------
208. ------------------------
Reasoning: The statement "She has good evidence of a linear relationship between the variables" is true because the confidence interval for the slope does not include zero, indicating a statistically significant relationship.
Answer: D
------------------------
209. Reasoning: A larger sample size is needed to provide a reliable estimate of the true proportion with a 90 percent confidence level and a margin of error of at most 0.08.
Answer: C
210. ------------------------
Reasoning: A correlation of 0.6 explains twice as much variation in y compared to a correlation of 0.3, making the percentage of variation in y explained by a correlation of 0.6 two times higher.
Answer: A
------------------------
211. ------------------------
Reasoning: A census is appropriate when detailed and accurate demographic information is required, making it necessary for resource allocation, policy-making, and planning for public services. This aligns with the need for a 95% confidence interval of the proportion of students in a small town who are taking some AP class, as it requires comprehensive data on the student population.
Answer: B
------------------------
212. ------------------------
Reasoning: The power of a significance test refers to the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (i.e., detecting a true effect). This is crucial to ensure that a study has enough power to detect a meaningful effect if it truly exists.
Answer: D
------------------------
213. ------------------------
Reasoning: Failing to reject the null hypothesis (H0) when it is false, meaning that the study concludes that Heartaid is not more effective than the current medication when it actually is, leading to patients not receiving the most effective treatment for preventing heart disease.
Answer: C
------------------------
214. ------------------------
Reasoning: The second class has a higher average score and a narrower score distribution compared to the first class because the score at the 80th percentile in the second class is higher than the score at the 40th percentile in the first class, indicating that students in the second class performed better overall.
Answer: B
------------------------
215. ------------------------
Reasoning: The z-score of -2.46 and the low P-value of 0.0069 indicate a statistically significant difference between the mean thrust values before and after the production process change, suggesting that the new process is producing engines with a mean thrust under 9500 pounds.
Answer: D
------------------------
216. ------------------------
Reasoning: Influential points in statistical analysis are data points that have a significant impact on the results of regression analysis, affecting the slope and correlation coefficient. The removal of the point (15,2) caused a drastic change in both the slope and correlation coefficient, indicating it is an influential point.
Answer: D
