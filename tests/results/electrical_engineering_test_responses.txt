Reasoning: The 16-bit registers in the 8085 microprocessor are specifically designed to handle larger data values and calculations that require more precision and range compared to the 8-bit registers commonly found in other microprocessors.
Answer: C
------------------------
134. ------------------------
Reasoning: Incorporating power system stabilizers, using flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS), and implementing wide-area monitoring systems (WAMS) can significantly increase the stability of a transmission line by providing better control and monitoring capabilities.
Answer: D
------------------------
135. ------------------------
Reasoning: A snubber circuit is used with an SCR to reduce voltage spikes and minimize false triggering, which is achieved by providing a path for transient energy to dissipate. This function is best served when the snubber circuit is connected in parallel with the SCR.
Answer: B
------------------------
136. ------------------------
Reasoning: The number of rings in the Bohr model corresponds to the number of electron shells in the atom, as each ring represents an energy level where electrons can orbit. Therefore, the number of rings is determined by the number of electrons in the atom, which is based on the atomic number.
Answer: D

Reasoning: Silicon and Germanium are both semiconducting elements widely used in the field of semiconductor technology.
Answer: D
------------------------
138. ------------------------
Reasoning: The standard number of output pins in 8085 microprocessors is 40, allowing for effective communication with external devices and peripherals.
Answer: B
------------------------
139. ------------------------
Reasoning: The power in a delta connected system will be higher than the power in a star connected system due to the configuration where each load receives the full line voltage, resulting in higher power output.
Answer: B
------------------------
140. ------------------------
Reasoning: The relaxation oscillator is easy to fabricate in a monolithic IC due to its simple structure, low component count, and compatibility with standard IC fabrication processes.
Answer: D
------------------------
141. ------------------------
Reasoning: The excitation must be a linear combination of independent sources for the superposition theorem to hold in a network with linear elements.
Answer: C
------------------------
142. ------------------------
Reasoning: The feedback factor in a Wien bridge oscillator using Op-Amp is determined by the ratio of resistors in the feedback network, which plays a crucial role in determining the stability and frequency of oscillation. A feedback factor greater than 1 can lead to instability. The correct answer should be less than 1, making option A (1/3) the most suitable choice.
Answer: A
------------------------
143. ------------------------
Reasoning: Wait states are always inserted between T2 and T3 to ensure proper synchronization and timing in the bus cycle of the processor.
Answer: B
------------------------
144. ------------------------
Reasoning: The relaxation oscillator is not a sinusoidal oscillator as it does not produce a smooth, continuous sinusoidal waveform. Instead, relaxation oscillators generate non-sinusoidal waveforms like square waves or sawtooth waves.
Answer: C
------------------------
145. ------------------------
Reasoning: The magnetic field around each portion of the wire in the circular loop will be perpendicular to the direction of current flow due to the right-hand rule.
Answer: B
------------------------
