Reasoning: Cliff nesting may be adaptive in this goose species if the survival rates of chicks from cliff nests are higher compared to those from beach nests. This could be due to the fact that cliff nesting provides better protection from predators, as it may be more difficult for predators to access the nests on cliffs compared to those on beaches. Additionally, cliff nesting may also provide easier access to the ocean for the chicks, as they can simply tumble down the cliff to reach the water, whereas chicks from beach nests may have to navigate through other obstacles. Overall, if the survival rates of chicks from cliff nests are higher, it suggests that cliff nesting is adaptive in this goose species.

Reasoning: Photoperiod is the most dependable environmental signal that a plant in a temperate ecosystem could use to initiate flowering at the correct time of the year, as plants in temperate regions rely on day length as a cue to trigger flowering.
Answer: B
------------------------
123. ------------------------
Reasoning: The low external pH disrupts the proton gradient by increasing the concentration of protons outside the mitochondria, negatively affecting ATP production. Proton pumps are essential for ATP synthesis in mitochondria and work more efficiently under acidic conditions.
Answer: A
------------------------
124. ------------------------
Reasoning: Nekton organisms are defined by their ability to actively swim and move independently in aquatic environments, unlike plankton or benthos. Among the options provided, a whale fits the description of an active swimmer capable of independent movement in aquatic environments, making it a nekton organism.
Answer: A
------------------------
125. ------------------------
Reasoning: Fixed action patterns are innate, stereotyped behaviors triggered by specific stimuli and once initiated, run to completion. The correct answer should reflect these characteristics.
Answer: A
------------------------
126. ------------------------
Reasoning: A flower with a tubular shape and bright colors would limit pollination by bees and promote hummingbird pollination.
Answer: C
------------------------
127. ------------------------
Reasoning: Double fertilization in flowering plants is a unique process where one sperm unites with the egg to form a zygote, and the other sperm unites with the polar nuclei to initiate the formation of endosperm, which provides nutrients for the developing embryo. This process is essential for seed development and is efficient in allocating resources properly. 
Answer: D
------------------------
128. ------------------------
Reasoning: Mutations in homeotic cluster genes in Drosophila are known to result in the transformation of one segment into another, affecting the normal body segment identity.
Answer: B
------------------------
129. ------------------------
Reasoning: Root pressure is primarily driven by the accumulation of solutes in the root cells, leading to a decrease in water potential and subsequent movement of water into the roots through osmosis.
Answer: C
------------------------
130. ------------------------
Reasoning: Adhesion plaques are not involved in the internalization process of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol complexes in cellular uptake of cholesterol.
Answer: B
------------------------
131. ------------------------
Reasoning: Xylem vessels are specialized for long-distance water and mineral transport in plants due to their efficient structure and function, making them suitable for providing support and conducting water and minerals.
Answer: C
------------------------
132. ------------------------
Reasoning: Juxtamedullary nephrons in the mammalian kidney allow the organism to produce hyperosmotic urine, which is a crucial function of excretory organs in maintaining homeostasis by regulating fluid balance.
Answer: D
------------------------
133. ------------------------
Reasoning: Batesian mimicry involves a harmless species evolving to mimic the appearance of a harmful or unpalatable species in order to gain protection from predators. The option that best fits this description is C, where a moth exhibits nearly identical coloration to that of a stinging bee.
Answer: C
------------------------
134. ------------------------
Reasoning: Keystone species are crucial in maintaining the balance and biodiversity within an ecosystem, regulating the population of other species and impacting the overall health and stability of the community. They prevent the dominance of certain species and promote the coexistence of a variety of species, contributing to the overall health and stability of the ecosystem.
Answer: B
------------------------
135. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should have the characteristics of high mutation rate, maternal inheritance, and lack of recombination, which are essential for studying the relatedness of animal populations using mitochondrial DNA.
Answer: B
------------------------
136. ------------------------
Reasoning: The quote suggests that human restructuring of ecosystems leads to simplification, disrupting the stabilizing influences of density-dependent regulatory factors. This disruption results in a simplified ecosystem structure with reduced biodiversity and complexity of species interactions.
Answer: A
------------------------
137. ------------------------
Reasoning: The presence of gray-bodied, vestigial-winged flies among the progeny can be best explained by crossing over between homologous chromosomes and the exchange of genetic material between linked genes, allowing for the recombination of the gray body and vestigial wings traits. 
Answer: A
------------------------
138. ------------------------
Reasoning: The oceans have the largest active pool of carbon on Earth, containing a significant amount of carbon that is actively cycled through various processes, making it the most influential in carbon cycling.
Answer: D
------------------------
139. ------------------------
Reasoning: The inheritance of both "fit" and "unfit" genes is not aligned with Charles Darwin's proposed conditions for natural selection, as he specifically focused on the survival and reproduction of individuals with advantageous traits. 
Answer: A
------------------------
140. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct statement about the cohesion-tension theory for the ascent of water in the xylem is that the evaporation of water from leaf mesophyll cells generates tension in the water column. This tension, combined with the cohesive properties of water molecules, allows for the movement of water upwards in the xylem.
Answer: A
------------------------
141. ------------------------
Reasoning: Chitin and glucans are the main components that reinforce cell walls in fungi, providing structural support and rigidity.
Answer: A
------------------------
142. ------------------------
Reasoning: Proton pumps actively transport protons out of the cells, creating a proton gradient that drives the cotransport of sugars into the phloem for transport.
Answer: C
------------------------
143. ------------------------
Reasoning: Early-successional plant communities are characterized by low species diversity and dominance of pioneer species that are fast-growing and able to quickly colonize disturbed habitats. Therefore, the correct answer is D. High detrital biomass.
Answer: D
------------------------
144. ------------------------
Reasoning: The symplastic pathway involves the movement of molecules through plasmodesmata, which are channels that connect plant cells and allow for the movement of substances such as sucrose between cells. This pathway is important for the transport of sucrose from the site of photosynthesis in mesophyll cells into the phloem for distribution throughout the plant. Therefore, the correct answer should involve the symplastic pathway and the use of plasmodesmata for the movement of sucrose.
Answer: C
