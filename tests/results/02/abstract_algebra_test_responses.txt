Reasoning: The degree of the field extension is the product of the degrees of the individual extensions, which are all 2 in this case.
Answer: D
------------------------
2. ------------------------
Reasoning: The cycle structure of p is (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), which means there is a cycle of length 4 and a cycle of length 2. The index of p in S_5 can be found by calculating the least common multiple of 4 and 2, which is 4. Hence, the index of p in S_5 is 4.
Answer: C
------------------------
3. Reasoning: The zeros of the polynomial x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x in Z_5 must be elements of Z_5, which are integers modulo 5, ranging from 0 to 4. The coefficients and zeros must be consistent with the field for the polynomial to be valid in Z_5.

Answer: D
4. ------------------------
Reasoning: A factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian, and the normality of a subgroup does not necessarily imply normality in the larger group.
Answer: C
------------------------
5. Reasoning: The product of the given polynomials should involve coefficients that are integers modulo 8, and the result should be simplified using modulo 8 arithmetic.
Answer: 6x^2 + 4x + 6
6. ------------------------
Reasoning: The two statements provided are contradictory as they give conflicting information about the number of elements of order 15 in a group.
Answer: C
------------------------
7. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should clearly differentiate between homomorphic images and factor groups. While homomorphic images of a group G are related to factor groups, they are not always isomorphic to them. It is important to understand the distinction between the two concepts to accurately answer the question.
Answer: C
------------------------
8. ------------------------
Reasoning: A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}. This property is fundamental to understanding ring homomorphisms.
Answer: A
------------------------
9. ------------------------
Reasoning: The field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is generated by adjoining sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), both of which are algebraic over Q with minimal polynomials of degree 2. The degree of the field extension is the product of the degrees of the minimal polynomials, which is 2 * 2 = 4. Therefore, the correct answer should have a degree of 4.
Answer: B
------------------------
10. ------------------------
Reasoning: The zeros of the polynomial x^3 + 2x + 2 in Z_7 are the elements of Z_7 that make the polynomial equal to zero when substituted into it. By checking each element of Z_7 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) in the polynomial, we find that x = 2 is the only value that results in the polynomial being equal to zero in Z_7.
Answer: A
------------------------
11. ------------------------
Reasoning: The left coset aH is equal to the right coset Ha, which implies that |aH| = |Ha|. However, the left coset aH and the right coset Hb are not necessarily identical unless a and b are related in a specific way. Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.
Answer: C
------------------------
12. ------------------------
Reasoning: The relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)} is reflexive and symmetric, as it includes pairs where each element is related to itself and satisfies the condition for symmetry. However, it is not transitive because it lacks the necessary elements to fulfill the transitivity property.
Answer: D
------------------------
13. ------------------------
Reasoning: To find the order of the factor group (Z_11 x Z_15)/(<1, 1>), we need to consider the cosets of the subgroup generated by the element (1, 1). By determining the number of cosets, we can apply Lagrange's theorem which states that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. This understanding of cosets and Lagrange's theorem is crucial in calculating the order of factor groups.
Answer: C
------------------------
14. ------------------------
Reasoning: The polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 can be factored into linear factors in Z_7[x] by finding the roots of the polynomial. By checking the possible linear factors in the form (x - a) where a is an element of Z_7, the correct factorization is (x + 1)(x + 4)(x - 2).
Answer: B
------------------------
15. ------------------------
Reasoning: The maximum possible order for an element of S_10 is determined by the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles, which in this case would be 10. This is because the order of an element in a permutation group is the smallest positive integer k such that raising the element to the power of k results in the identity permutation.
Answer: D
------------------------
16. ------------------------
Reasoning: A field with 60 elements cannot be a splitting field of a polynomial over Q because the order of a finite field must be a power of a prime number according to the fundamental theorem of finite fields. Since 60 is not a power of a prime number, a field with 60 elements cannot be a splitting field of a polynomial over Q.
Answer: D
------------------------
17. Reasoning: The inverse of -i in the multiplicative group {1, -1, i, -i} is i because the inverse of a complex number is the complex conjugate of that number.
Answer: C
18. ------------------------
Reasoning: The product of (2,3)(3,5) in Z_5 x Z_9 should be calculated by multiplying the components separately and then taking the result modulo 5 and modulo 9 respectively. The product of 2 and 3 modulo 5 is 1, and the product of 3 and 5 modulo 9 is 1. Therefore, the correct answer is (1,1).
Answer: A
------------------------
19. ------------------------
Reasoning: The set of real numbers under multiplication does not form a group due to the lack of closure under inverses, as not all real numbers have multiplicative inverses.
Answer: D
------------------------
20. ------------------------
Reasoning: Every group of order p^2 where p is prime is Abelian. For a Sylow p-subgroup of a group G to be a normal subgroup, it must be the only Sylow p-subgroup of G. These statements align with the properties of Abelian groups and the conditions for normality of Sylow p-subgroups.
Answer: A
------------------------
21. ------------------------
Reasoning: The statement |G + H| = |G||H| implies that the order of the internal direct product is equal to the product of the orders of the two subgroups, which is a characteristic of the internal direct product. Additionally, the existence of a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s in Z_m + Z_n is directly related to the divisibility relationships between r, m, s, and n.
Answer: C
------------------------
22. ------------------------
Reasoning: When adding the polynomials f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 in Z_8[x], we need to perform addition of coefficients modulo 8. 
f(x) = 4x - 5 becomes 4x + 3 (mod 8) and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 becomes 2x^2 + 4x + 2 (mod 8). 
Adding these polynomials modulo 8, we get 2x^2 + 8x + 5, which simplifies to 2x^2 + 0x + 5 (mod 8), resulting in 2x^2 + 5.
Answer: A

Reasoning: Every maximal ideal is a prime ideal in a commutative ring, and if I is a maximal ideal of a commutative ring R, then R/I is a field.
Answer: A
------------------------
26. ------------------------
Reasoning: The set G of all n x n non-singular matrices with rational numbers as entries is closed under multiplication, as the product of two non-singular matrices is also non-singular. This closure property is essential for a group structure.
Answer: A
------------------------
27. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because every group of order 42 has a normal subgroup of order 7 based on the Sylow theorems.
Answer: C
------------------------
28. ------------------------
Reasoning: The polynomial satisfies the Eisenstein criterion with p=3 because 3 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient, 3 does not divide the constant term, and 3^2 does not divide the constant term.
Answer: B
------------------------
29. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 2 directly addresses the possibility of a homomorphism from a group of 6 elements to a group of 12 elements.
Answer: D
------------------------
30. ------------------------
Reasoning: Both statements are true because homomorphisms preserve the properties of groups, such as being cyclic or Abelian.
Answer: A
------------------------
31. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should be Statement 2 because it specifically mentions that if a subgroup H is normal in a group G, then for any element a in G, the elements in H commute with a. This is a key characteristic of normal subgroups, as it implies that the left and right cosets of H are the same, leading to important properties such as the existence of a quotient group G/H. This property is crucial in various areas of group theory and is a defining feature of normal subgroups.
Answer: C
------------------------
32. ------------------------
Reasoning: The property (ab)^-1 = a^-1b^-1 is a characteristic property of abelian groups in abstract algebra. Since this property is satisfied in the group (G, .), the correct answer is an Abelian group.
Answer: B
------------------------
33. ------------------------
Reasoning: In a finite dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors is contained in a basis. However, the cardinality of bases for the same vector space can vary, so |B_1| does not necessarily equal |B_2|.
Answer: C
------------------------
34. ------------------------
Reasoning: The commutative property of the group operation is a defining characteristic of abelian groups. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect this commutativity. Option A, g = g^-1 for every g in G, does not necessarily hold true for all elements in an abelian group. Option B, g = g^2 for every g in G, is not a characteristic of abelian groups. Option C, (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G, is not a general property of abelian groups. Option D, G is of finite order, is not a requirement for abelian groups. The correct answer is A, g = g^-1 for every g in G, as it aligns with the commutative property of abelian groups.
Answer: A
------------------------
35. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true as a linear transformation can be injective when dim(V) < dim(W). Statement 2 is false because injectivity alone does not guarantee bijectivity. 
Answer: C
------------------------
36. ------------------------
Reasoning: The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 4 because both sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are algebraic over Q and are linearly independent over Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)) respectively, resulting in a basis of {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)} with 4 elements.
Answer: B
------------------------
37. ------------------------
Reasoning: The product of (20)(-8) in Z_26 should be computed as (-160) mod 26, which simplifies to 6 in Z_26. This is because in Z_26, all operations are performed modulo 26 to ensure that the result stays within the ring and follows the properties of a ring structure.
Answer: C
------------------------
38. ------------------------
Reasoning: The constant term of the polynomial x^2 - 12 is -12, which is not divisible by 2^2 = 4. Therefore, the constant term satisfies the Eisenstein criterion, indicating that the polynomial x^2 - 12 is irreducible over Q.
Answer: A
------------------------
39. ------------------------
Reasoning: The generator for the finite field Z_7 should be a primitive root of 7, which is a primitive element that can generate all other elements of the field when raised to different powers.
Answer: A
------------------------
40. ------------------------
Reasoning: From the perspective of definitions of permutations and cycles in mathematics, Statement 1 is true because a permutation is a rearrangement of elements in a set, which can be represented as a cycle in cycle notation. However, Statement 2 is false because not every cycle is a permutation since a cycle represents a specific type of permutation where elements are cyclically rearranged.
Answer: C
------------------------
41. ------------------------
Reasoning: The identity element in a group is the element that leaves other elements unchanged when combined with them. In this case, the identity element should be 0 because a + 0 + 1 = a for all integers a in Z, satisfying the definition of an identity element.
Answer: A
------------------------
42. ------------------------
Reasoning: Z_3 x 3Z is the direct product of Z_3 and 3Z, resulting in pairs of elements (a, 3b) where a is in Z_3 and b is in 3Z. The characteristic of 3Z is that it consists of integers that are multiples of 3, so the correct characteristic for Z_3 x 3Z is 3.
Answer: B
------------------------
43. ------------------------
Reasoning: The subgroup of order 10 in an abelian group of order 45 is a normal subgroup because the number of left cosets of the subgroup is equal to the number of right cosets of the subgroup.
Answer: C
------------------------
44. ------------------------
Reasoning: The characteristic of a ring refers to the smallest positive integer n such that n times any element in the ring equals zero. In an integral domain with characteristic 0, this means that there is no such integer n, indicating that the ring has infinitely many elements. On the other hand, in an integral domain with prime characteristic, the order of elements is determined by the prime number p, leading to a finite number of elements in the ring. Therefore, Statement 1 is true as it correctly reflects the relationship between the characteristic of a ring and its size or cardinality.
Answer: A
------------------------
45. ------------------------
Reasoning: The function f must necessarily be surjective because g(f(a)) = a for all a in A implies that every element in A has a pre-image in B under function f, which is a characteristic of surjectivity.
Answer: C

48. ------------------------
Reasoning: The polynomial x^3 + x^2 + c should be irreducible over Z_3 to form a field in Z_3[x]/(x^3 + x^2 + c).
Answer: B
------------------------
49. ------------------------
Reasoning: The first statement is true because if R is an integral domain, then R[x] is also an integral domain due to the preservation of integral domain properties under polynomial ring extensions. The second statement is false because the degree of the product of two polynomials in R[x] is not necessarily equal to the sum of the degrees of the individual polynomials.
Answer: C
------------------------
50. ------------------------
Reasoning: The maximum possible order for an element in Z_8 x Z_10 x Z_24 is the least common multiple of the orders of the individual components of the direct product. The prime factorizations of 8, 10, and 24 are 2^3, 2*5, and 2^3*3 respectively. Therefore, the least common multiple of 8, 10, and 24 is 2^3*3*5 = 120.
Answer: B
------------------------
51. ------------------------
Reasoning: Every group of prime-power order is solvable, which makes Statement 2 true.
Answer: D
------------------------
52. ------------------------
Reasoning: The polynomial x^3 + cx^2 + 1 must be irreducible over Z_3 for Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) to be a field. If c is equal to 0, the polynomial reduces to x^3 + 1 which is not irreducible over Z_3. Therefore, c cannot be equal to 0 for Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) to be a field.
Answer: B
------------------------
53. ------------------------
Reasoning: In a group under multiplication, the identity element is defined as the element that when multiplied by any other element in the group, leaves that element unchanged. In the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8) under multiplication modulo 10, the element 1 satisfies this property. When any element in the group is multiplied by 1, the result is the same element, making 1 the identity element in this group.
Answer: A
------------------------
54. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should consider the fact that groups of the same order may not necessarily be isomorphic because isomorphism depends on the internal structure of the groups, not just their order. However, since all three groups G, H, and K are of order 4, according to Statement 1, at least two of them are isomorphic. Statement 2 also provides a condition for isomorphism between subgroups Z_r + Z_s and Z_m + Z_n, where r divides m and s divides n. Both statements are true based on the properties of group theory and subgroup isomorphism.
Answer: A. True, True
------------------------
55. ------------------------
Reasoning: The field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q involves adding the square root of 2 to the rational numbers, resulting in a degree 2 extension. The degree of an extension field is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial of the element generating the extension field, which in this case is 2.
Answer: B
------------------------
56. ------------------------
Reasoning: A free abelian group is a group that can be generated by a set of elements without any relations among them, while a torsion-free abelian group is a group in which every non-zero element has infinite order. Based on these definitions, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.
Answer: C
------------------------
57. ------------------------
Reasoning: The polynomial 4x - 2 is irreducible over Z because it cannot be factored into non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. However, it is reducible over Q as it can be factored into 2(2x - 1).
Answer: C
------------------------
58. ------------------------
Reasoning: The generator for the finite field Z_11 should be a primitive root of 11 because it generates all non-zero elements in Z_11.
Answer: A

59. ------------------------
Reasoning: A group of order 102 cannot be cyclic because every group of order 102 has a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, as stated in Statement 2.
Answer: D
------------------------
60. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because it correctly states the property of subgroups and normal subgroups in a group. Statement 2 is false because not all groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian, as there exist non-Abelian groups of this order such as the dihedral group D4.
Answer: C
------------------------
61. ------------------------
Reasoning: The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring for the subring to inherit the multiplicative structure of the ring.
Answer: C

63. Reasoning: The first statement correctly describes the properties of a quotient ring of a commutative ring, while the second statement accurately states the condition for an ideal N to be equal to the entire ring R.
Answer: C
64. ------------------------
Reasoning: ~ is not anti-symmetric because for a relation to be anti-symmetric, if (a, b) and (b, a) are in the relation, then a must be equal to b. In this case, (1, 2) and (2, 1) are not in ~, so the condition for anti-symmetry is not violated.
Answer: A
------------------------
65. ------------------------
Reasoning: The number of homomorphisms from Z to Z_2 is limited to 2 because Z is an infinite cyclic group and Z_2 is a cyclic group of order 2. Any homomorphism from Z to Z_2 must map the generator of Z to an element of order 1 or 2 in Z_2, resulting in only two possible homomorphisms.
Answer: B
------------------------
66. ------------------------
Reasoning: Every field is a ring, but not every ring has a multiplicative identity. Therefore, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.
Answer: C
------------------------
67. ------------------------
Reasoning: The degree of the sum of two polynomials in a ring is equal to the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. This property is crucial in understanding polynomial rings and their operations. Additionally, every ideal in a field being principal is a characteristic of fields, not rings.
Answer: C. True, False
------------------------
68. ------------------------
Reasoning: The subset H of a group (G,*) is a group if it contains the identity element of G, exhibits closure under the group operation, and has inverses for all elements in H. This ensures that H satisfies the fundamental properties of a group.
Answer: D
------------------------
69. ------------------------
Reasoning: The factorization of x^4 + 4 in Z_5[x] involves using the fact that x^4 + 4 = (x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2) because this polynomial can be factored using the sum and difference of squares formula.
Answer: B
------------------------
70. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 aligns with the definition of abelian groups being free on a set of generators. Statement 2 provides a specific condition for a finitely generated abelian group to be free abelian.
Answer: A
------------------------
71. ------------------------
Reasoning: The inverse of an element a in a group is an element b such that a*b = e, where e is the identity element. In this case, the operation * is defined as a*b = a+b+1. Therefore, the inverse of a specific element a in the group (Z,*) can be found by setting a*b = a+b+1 = e, where e is the identity element. Solving for b, we get b = -a-1, which is the inverse of a in this group.
Answer: B
------------------------
72. ------------------------
Reasoning: The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q is 4 because the elements involved, sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), are linearly independent over Q, resulting in a basis of {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)} with 4 elements.
Answer: B
------------------------
73. ------------------------
Reasoning: Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 mod p. In this case, 23 is a prime number and 3 is not divisible by 23. Therefore, we can simplify the calculation by finding the remainder of 3^47 by reducing the exponent modulo 22 (p-1). Since 47 is congruent to 1 mod 22, the remainder will be the same as 3^1 mod 23, which is 3.
Answer: C
------------------------
74. ------------------------
Reasoning: Z_3 x Z_3 is a field, a finite commutative ring with unity where every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.
Answer: D
------------------------
75. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because in a group, if a and b are distinct elements, then their squares will also be distinct. Statement 2 is false because the set of rotations in a dihedral group does not form a cyclic subgroup due to the presence of reflections which do not have a fixed order like rotations.
Answer: C
------------------------
76. ------------------------
Reasoning: The given statements demonstrate the properties of inverses in a group, where the order of elements is reversed when taking the inverse. Statement 1 shows this property with (ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2}, indicating that a and b are inverses of each other. Statement 2 also aligns with the property of inverses in a group, (ab)^n = a^nb^n, showcasing that a and b are inverses. 
Answer: A
------------------------
77. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because S_n is non-Abelian for all n >= 3, meaning it is not commutative. Statement 2 is false because the order of the product of two permutations as m-cycles and n-cycles is not equal to the least common multiple of their cycle lengths.
Answer: C
------------------------
78. ------------------------
Reasoning: Z x Z is an integral domain with no zero divisors, indicating that the characteristic of the ring Z x Z is 0.
Answer: A
------------------------
79. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 describes the set {1,2, ..., n-1} forming a group under multiplication modulo n, which satisfies the properties required for a group. Statement 2 is false because there is no integer x that satisfies 63x mod 100 = 1 due to the lack of a modular multiplicative inverse of 63 modulo 100.
Answer: C
------------------------
80. ------------------------
Reasoning: A nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group is also free abelian. Therefore, Statement 1 is true. However, the freeness of the quotient group G / K is not guaranteed to be free abelian. The freeness of the quotient group depends on the specific properties of the subgroup K and the larger group G. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.
Answer: C
------------------------
81. ------------------------
Reasoning: The external direct product of cyclic groups is indeed cyclic, so Statement 1 is true. However, the external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is not isomorphic to D_12, making Statement 2 false.
Answer: C
------------------------
82. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is false because not every nonzero free abelian group necessarily has a basis with an infinite number of elements. Statement 2 is true because for a free abelian group of rank at least 2, there must be at least 2 elements in any basis, leading to an infinite number of bases.
Answer: C
------------------------
83. ------------------------
Reasoning: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group, aligning with the definition and properties of finite cyclic groups.
Answer: C
------------------------
84. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is false because having an element of order 10 does not necessarily imply the existence of elements of orders 1, 2, and 5 in the group. Statement 2 is true because if a group has an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, then it must have an element of order 6.
Answer: C
------------------------
85. ------------------------
Reasoning: The function g must necessarily be surjective because the composition of g and f ensures that every element in set A has a pre-image in set B, which is a characteristic of a surjective function.
Answer: C
------------------------
86. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because it correctly defines the property of a one-to-one homomorphism in terms of the kernel being the identity element alone. Statement 2 is false because the image of a group under a homomorphism cannot have more elements than the original group, so it cannot have 4 elements if the original group has only 6 elements.
Answer: C
------------------------
87. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should involve the formula |HK| = |H||K|/|H intersection K| because this formula is used to determine the size of the product of two subgroups in a group.

88. Reasoning: The function T is linear, and we can express T(-3, 2) as a linear combination of the given values T(1, 0) = 3 and T(0, 1) = -5.
Answer: A. -19
89. ------------------------
Reasoning: In Z_24, all operations are performed modulo 24. When computing the product (12)(16), we get 192. To stay within the ring, we need to reduce this modulo 24, which results in 0. 
Answer: A
------------------------
90. ------------------------
Reasoning: Permutations are arrangements of elements in a set, where each element appears exactly once. This means that every permutation is a one-to-one function because each element is mapped to a unique element in the set. On the other hand, a one-to-one function is a function where each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain, but not all one-to-one functions are permutations. This is because a one-to-one function may not necessarily rearrange elements in a set like a permutation does. Therefore, Statement 1 is true while Statement 2 is false.
Answer: C
------------------------
91. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should be consistent with the properties of subgroups and element orders in finite group theory. Statement 1 is true because for a finite group of order n, there exists a subgroup of order d for every positive divisor d of n. Statement 2 is also true because if an element a belongs to a finite group G, then the order of a divides the order of G. Both statements align with the fundamental concepts of finite group theory.
Answer: A
------------------------
92. ------------------------
Reasoning: The cosets of the subgroup 4Z in 2Z will be determined by the elements of 2Z that are congruent to each other modulo 4. The number of distinct cosets is 2 because the index of the subgroup 4Z in 2Z is 2.
Answer: B
------------------------
93. ------------------------
Reasoning: Every equivalence relation is not necessarily a partial-ordering relation, as equivalence relations satisfy reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, while partial-ordering relations satisfy reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.
Answer: B
------------------------
94. ------------------------
Reasoning: The maximum possible order of an element in S_n is determined by the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. For n = 6, the cycles can have lengths that divide 6, which are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The maximum order will be achieved when the cycles are of length 6, resulting in the least common multiple of 6, which is 6.
Answer: A
------------------------
95. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is true because an extension field of a field F is a field that contains F and is contained in a larger field that is also a field. Statement 1 indicates that Q is an extension field of Z_2, which means Q contains Z_2 and is contained in a larger field. Statement 2 is true because every non-constant polynomial over a field has a zero in some extension field, which is a fundamental property of extension fields in abstract algebra.
Answer: A
------------------------
96. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 correctly states the condition for aH to be a subgroup of G, aligning with the definition of a subgroup. Statement 2 incorrectly states the condition for aH = bH, making it false.

Reasoning: The number of elements in a cyclic subgroup generated by an element is equal to the order of that element in the group. To find the order of 25 in Z_30, we need to calculate the smallest positive integer 'n' such that 25^n ≡ 1 (mod 30). This will give us the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup generated by 25.
