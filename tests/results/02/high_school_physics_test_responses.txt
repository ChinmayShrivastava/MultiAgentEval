Reasoning: The total flight time of the soccer ball can be calculated by analyzing both the horizontal and vertical components of motion. The horizontal component of the initial velocity is determined by the cosine of the launch angle, which in this case is 30°. Therefore, the horizontal component of the initial velocity is 10 m/s * cos(30°) = 8.66 m/s. Since there is no horizontal acceleration, the time taken to cover the horizontal distance is determined by the horizontal component of velocity and the horizontal distance traveled. The total flight time will be the same as the time taken to cover the horizontal distance. Using the equation x = x0 + v0x * t, where x0 = 0 (initial horizontal position), v0x = 8.66 m/s, and x is the horizontal distance traveled, we can solve for t. The total flight time is 8.66 m / 10 m/s = 0.866 s, which is closest to 1 s.

Reasoning: The object would experience a gravitational force towards the center of the Earth throughout its journey because gravity pulls objects towards the center of mass. The object's velocity would gradually decrease to zero as it reaches the center of the Earth, then increase again as it moves towards the other side because of the gravitational pull. The object would be falling in a vacuum-like environment with no air resistance to slow it down. The object's acceleration would increase towards the center of the Earth, reach maximum acceleration at the center, and then decrease towards the other side due to the gravitational pull. The object would experience simple harmonic motion as it gains kinetic energy falling towards the center and converts it to potential energy moving towards the other side. The object's potential energy decreases as it descends and increases as it ascends through the Earth. The object would experience simple harmonic motion due to the gravitational force acting on it. The Earth's rotation would cause the object to oscillate back and forth within the hole. The object's motion would be unaffected by the Earth's magnetic field.

Reasoning: When the three 18 μF capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance of the circuit becomes 6 μF (1/6 = 1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18). Since the total charge stored in the circuit is 600 μC, the charge stored on each capacitor will also be 600 μC. This is because charge is conserved in a closed system, so the total charge remains the same regardless of how the capacitors are arranged.
Answer: C
