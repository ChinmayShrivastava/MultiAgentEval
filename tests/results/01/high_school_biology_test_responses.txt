Reasoning: The pH of Lake A is 8.0, indicating an alkaline environment, while Lake B has a pH of 6.0, suggesting an acidic environment. The difference in pH levels between the two lakes can impact the aquatic organisms and ecosystem health. A pH of 6.0 in Lake B is acidic and can be harmful to aquatic life, making it less favorable for many species. Therefore, Lake B is not alkaline, and it is not 100 times more alkaline than Lake A. The hydrogen ion concentration of Lake B is not 10^4 M, as pH 6.0 corresponds to a hydrogen ion concentration of 10^-6 M. Acid rain, which is acidic, can further lower the pH of Lake B, making it more acidic.

Reasoning: The metabolic difference of African lungfish releasing urea instead of ammonia provides them with an advantage in terms of energy efficiency and overall fitness in their ecosystem. Releasing urea requires less energy expenditure for synthesis compared to ammonia, allowing the lungfish to allocate more energy towards other essential functions such as growth and reproduction. Additionally, urea is less toxic than ammonia and can be stored in the body for longer periods, enabling the lungfish to survive in low-oxygen environments such as small, stagnant freshwater pools where other fish may struggle to thrive. This metabolic adaptation contributes to the overall success of African lungfish in their unique habitat.
Answer: B

Reasoning: The protein that prevents the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter site should have specificity in targeting RNA polymerase binding and a known mechanism of action. It should physically block the binding site or alter its conformation to inhibit RNA polymerase binding. It should directly interact with RNA polymerase or the promoter site to prevent their binding. The inhibition of RNA polymerase binding can disrupt gene transcription, impact protein synthesis, and regulate gene expression.
Answer: B
------------------------
