Reasoning: The NPV of the investment project can be calculated by discounting the future cash flows back to the present value using the formula. Given that the project costs $500 today and generates profits of $500 in year five and year ten, the present value of these cash flows at a 10% discount rate would be $500 / (1 + 0.10)^5 + $500 / (1 + 0.10)^10. Calculating this results in a total present value of approximately $248.69. Therefore, the NPV of the project would be $248.69 - $500 = -$251.31, which is closest to option B. 
Answer: B

Reasoning: The total cost per unit for Spark Co. includes the purchase price of $125, sales commission of $25 per phone sold, and fixed costs of $3000. This totals to $150 per unit. 
------------------------
Reasoning: The revenue generated per unit sold at the selling price of $200 is $175 ($200 - $25 commission). 
------------------------
Reasoning: The profit margin per unit should be 20% because Spark Co. desires a profit of 10% of sales, which means the profit margin per unit should be double that percentage.
------------------------
Reasoning: To calculate the number of units Spark Co. must sell to achieve the desired profit margin of 10%, we divide the total fixed costs and desired profit by the profit margin per unit. This gives us 400 units.

Answer: B
------------------------
151. ------------------------
Reasoning: Errors in ending inventory and depreciation expense directly impact the calculation of pretax income. An overstatement of ending inventory will result in lower pretax income, while an understatement of depreciation expense will result in higher pretax income.

The difference in funds released can be calculated by multiplying the change in turnover (8 - 5 = 3) by the initial COGS ($800,000). Therefore, $240,000 is released, not invested additionally.
Answer: A
------------------------
157. ------------------------
Reasoning: The statement "Management is responsible for making all financial records and related information available to us" aligns with the responsibility of the client to provide access to necessary information for the audit process, which is a common inclusion in an auditor's engagement letter.

Reasoning: To calculate the break-even point, we need to consider the contribution margin per unit of DVD players, which is $40. The total contribution margin needed to cover the fixed costs of $90000 can be calculated by dividing the fixed costs by the contribution margin per unit, resulting in 2250 units. However, since the sales mix estimate is one home entertainment system for every four DVD players sold, we need to adjust the number of DVD players needed to break even. For every one home entertainment system sold, the company sells four DVD players. Therefore, to break even, the company needs to sell 2250 DVD players multiplied by 4, which equals 9000 DVD players.
