Reasoning: The degree of the field extension is calculated as the product of the degrees of the minimal polynomials of the elements involved. In this case, the minimal polynomials for sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18) are all irreducible over Q and have degrees 2, 2, and 2 respectively. Therefore, the degree of the field extension is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

Reasoning: The zeros of the polynomial x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x in the finite field Z_5 are the elements of Z_5 that satisfy the polynomial equation when substituted into it, resulting in a value of 0. Therefore, the correct answer is the elements in Z_5 that make the polynomial equal to 0, which are 0 and 4.
Answer: D

Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian. Statement 2 is false because the normality of subgroups does not necessarily transfer to the larger group.
Answer: C
------------------------
5. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should be the result of multiplying the given polynomials f(x) and g(x) in Z_8[x], considering the coefficients are integers modulo 8 and operations are performed modulo 8. By multiplying each term of f(x) with each term of g(x) and reducing coefficients modulo 8, we can find the product.
Answer: B
------------------------
6. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should be consistent with Lagrange's theorem, which states that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Therefore, the total number of elements in the group must be a multiple of 15. 
Answer: C
------------------------
7. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should state that every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G, but it does not necessarily mean that every homomorphic image can be uniquely identified as a factor group. This distinction is crucial in understanding the relationship between homomorphic images and factor groups in group theory.
Answer: C
------------------------
8. ------------------------
Reasoning: A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0} because a ring homomorphism is defined as a function between two rings that preserves the ring structure, and the kernel of a ring homomorphism is the set of elements that map to the identity element in the codomain ring. If the kernel is {0}, then the homomorphism is one to one, meaning distinct elements in the domain map to distinct elements in the codomain.
Answer: C
------------------------
9. ------------------------
Reasoning: The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q is equal to 4, as the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) over Q is x^4 - 10x^2 + 1, which is irreducible over Q.
Answer: B
------------------------
10. ------------------------
Reasoning: The zeros of the polynomial x^3 + 2x + 2 in Z_7 are the elements in Z_7 that satisfy the equation x^3 + 2x + 2 = 0. Therefore, the correct answer is the element(s) that make the polynomial equal to zero in the finite field Z_7.
Answer: C
------------------------
11. ------------------------
Reasoning: From the perspective of understanding the concept of subgroups in group theory, statement 1 is true as the order of left coset aH is equal to the order of right coset Ha. However, statement 2 is false as aH and Hb can be either identical or disjoint depending on the elements a and b chosen.
Answer: C. True, False
------------------------
12. ------------------------
Reasoning: The relation S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)} only includes elements 1 and 2, which are part of set A = {1, 2, 3}. This means that the relation S is a subset of set A, as it only includes elements that are present in set A.
Answer: A
------------------------
13. ------------------------
Reasoning: The order of the factor group is calculated by dividing the product of the orders of the two cyclic groups (11 * 15) by the order of the subgroup generated by <1, 1>, which is 1. Therefore, the order of the factor group is 11 * 15 / 1 = 165.
Answer: B
------------------------
14. ------------------------
Reasoning: The factorization of the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 in Z_7[x] should consist of linear factors with coefficients from Z_7. By checking the options, the correct factorization that meets these criteria is (x - 1)(x - 4)(x - 2).
Answer: D
------------------------
15. ------------------------
Reasoning: The maximum possible order for an element of S_n for n = 10 is n, which is 10 in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 105, as it is the closest option to 10.
Answer: D
------------------------
16. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because a splitting field of a polynomial over Q is a field extension that contains all the roots of the polynomial, allowing the polynomial to be completely factored into linear factors over that field. The significance of having a field with 60 elements and its relation to the properties of finite fields indicates that a field with 60 elements is a finite field, which is crucial in various mathematical contexts.
Answer: C

18. ------------------------
Reasoning: The product of (2,3)(3,5) in Z_5 x Z_9 should be computed component-wise and reduced modulo the respective moduli, resulting in (2*3 mod 5, 3*5 mod 9) = (1,6).
Answer: C
------------------------
19. ------------------------
Reasoning: The set of all real numbers under the usual multiplication operation does not form a group because it lacks an identity element, which is a fundamental property of a group.
Answer: C
------------------------
20. ------------------------
Reasoning: Groups of order p^2 where p is prime are always Abelian, so Statement 1 is true. However, the existence of a unique Sylow p-subgroup does not necessarily imply it is normal, so Statement 2 is false.
Answer: C
------------------------
21. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is correct because the cardinality of the internal direct product of two finite groups G and H is equal to the product of the cardinalities of G and H. The existence of a subgroup isomorphic to Z_r + Z_s in Z_m + Z_n when r divides m and s divides n is also true.
Answer: A
------------------------
22. ------------------------
Reasoning: When adding the polynomials f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 in Z_8[x], we need to perform arithmetic operations modulo 8 for each coefficient. 
4x + 2x^2 - 5 - 4x + 2 = 2x^2 - 3
Since we are working in Z_8[x], we need to reduce the coefficients modulo 8. The resulting polynomial is 2x^2 - 3, which is equivalent to 2x^2 + 5 in Z_8[x].
Answer: A
------------------------
23. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 2 accurately describes the relationship between the dimension of a vector space and the number of linearly independent vectors spanning it.

Reasoning: The set G of all n x n non-singular matrices with rational numbers as entries should form a group under multiplication, exhibiting closure, associativity, and the existence of inverses. This means that the correct answer should be a subgroup.
Answer: A
------------------------
27. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is correct because a normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation by elements of the group, and in a group of order 42, which is the product of 2 and 3 distinct prime numbers, there must exist a normal subgroup of order 7 due to the Sylow theorems. Statement 2 is incorrect because a group of order 42 does not necessarily have a normal subgroup of order 8, as 8 is not a divisor of 42.
Answer: C
------------------------
28. ------------------------
Reasoning: The polynomial 8x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x + 24 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion for irreducibility with p=3 because 3 divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient, 3 does not divide the constant term, and 3^2 does not divide the constant term.
Answer: B
------------------------
29. ------------------------
Reasoning: A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two groups, and it is possible to have a homomorphism from a group of 6 elements to a group of 12 elements.
Answer: C
------------------------
30. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because a cyclic group is defined as a group generated by a single element, and the homomorphic image of a cyclic group will also be generated by a single element, making it cyclic as well. Statement 2 is true because homomorphisms preserve the group structure, so if the original group is Abelian, then the homomorphic image will also be Abelian.
Answer: A
------------------------
31. ------------------------
Reasoning: When a subgroup H is normal in a group G, it means that for any element a in G and any element h in H, the product ah is equal to ha. This property is crucial in understanding the behavior of elements in the group G with respect to the subgroup H.
Answer: C
------------------------
32. ------------------------
Reasoning: The condition (ab)^-1 = a^-1b^-1 can be rewritten as ab = ba for all a, b in G. This implies that the group operation is commutative, meaning that the order of elements does not matter when performing the operation. Therefore, the correct answer should be a group where the operation is commutative.
Answer: B
------------------------
33. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because in a finite dimensional vector space, every linearly independent set of vectors can be extended to form a basis. Statement 2 is false because the cardinality of a basis is always the same for a given vector space, regardless of the specific choice of basis.
Answer: C
------------------------
34. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should reflect the commutativity property of abelian groups. Option A, g = g^-1 for every g in G, is not necessarily true for abelian groups. Option B, g = g^2 for every g in G, is not a characteristic of abelian groups. Option C, (g o h)^2 = g^2 o h^2 for every g,h in G, is not a general property of abelian groups. Option D, G is of finite order, is not a requirement for abelian groups. The commutativity of the group operation is the defining characteristic of abelian groups.
Answer: A
------------------------
35. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true as it aligns with the concept that if the dimension of the codomain is greater than the dimension of the domain, then a linear transformation must be injective. Statement 2 is false because injective linear transformations do not necessarily have to be bijective.
Answer: C
------------------------
36. ------------------------
Reasoning: The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 4 because it involves both square roots of 2 and 3, which are algebraic over Q and linearly independent over Q(sqrt(2)) and Q(sqrt(3)). The degree of a composite field extension is the product of the degrees of the individual extensions.
Answer: B
------------------------
37. ------------------------
Reasoning: When computing the product (20)(-8) in Z_26, we first multiply the numbers as integers, which gives us -160. Then, we take this result modulo 26 to ensure it stays within the ring. -160 mod 26 is equivalent to 6 in Z_26. Therefore, the correct answer is 6, which corresponds to option C.
Answer: C
------------------------
38. ------------------------
Reasoning: The polynomial x^2 - 12 satisfies the Eisenstein criterion with p=2 because 2 divides -12 but 2^2=4 does not divide -12. Therefore, x^2 - 12 is irreducible over Q.
Answer: A

Answer: C
------------------------
41. ------------------------
Reasoning: The identity element in a group is defined as an element that leaves other elements unchanged when combined with them under the group operation. In this case, the identity element for the set of integers Z with the binary operation "*" defined as a*b = a + b + 1 should be an element that, when added to any other integer, results in the original integer. The element that satisfies this condition is 0.
Answer: A
------------------------
42. ------------------------
Reasoning: Z_3 x 3Z is a direct product of two rings, Z_3 and 3Z, with operations defined component-wise. The characteristic of Z_3 is 3 and the characteristic of 3Z is also 3. Therefore, the characteristic of Z_3 x 3Z is the least common multiple of 3 and 3, which is 3.
Answer: B
------------------------
43. ------------------------
Reasoning: In an abelian group, all subgroups are normal subgroups because of the commutative property, making the number of left cosets equal to the number of right cosets. Additionally, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group in abelian groups.
Answer: A. True, True
------------------------
44. ------------------------
Reasoning: Every integral domain with prime characteristic is finite because the characteristic determines the order of the elements in the domain. Since the characteristic is prime, it means that the domain has a finite number of elements, leading to the conclusion that the integral domain with prime characteristic is finite.
Answer: D
------------------------
45. ------------------------
Reasoning: The function f must necessarily be injective because an injective function ensures that each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain, which is necessary in this scenario to satisfy the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.
Answer: C

Answer: B
------------------------
49. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should be A because both statements are true. Statement 1 correctly states that if R is an integral domain, then R[x] is an integral domain, which is a property inherited by polynomial rings.

Answer: D
------------------------
52. ------------------------
Reasoning: The value of c in Z_3 that would result in Z_3[x]/(x^3 + cx^2 + 1) being a field is c = 2 because the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 + 1 is irreducible over Z_3, which is a necessary condition for the quotient ring to be a field.
Answer: B
------------------------
53. ------------------------
Reasoning: The identity element in a group is defined as an element that leaves other elements unchanged when combined with them through the group operation. In this case, the identity element in the group G = {2, 4, 6, 8) under multiplication modulo 10 is 1, as it leaves other elements unchanged when multiplied.
Answer: A
------------------------
54. ------------------------
Reasoning: The statement implies that if all three groups G, H, and K are not isomorphic, then the statement would be false. Therefore, at least two of them must be isomorphic.
Answer: A
------------------------
55. ------------------------
Reasoning: The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)) over Q is 2 because the element sqrt(2) satisfies the minimal polynomial x^2 - 2 over Q, making it a degree 2 extension.
Answer: B

57. ------------------------
Reasoning: The polynomial 4x - 2 can be factored as 2(2x - 1) over Z, making it reducible. However, it cannot be further factored over Q, making it irreducible. Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.
Answer: C
------------------------
58. ------------------------
Reasoning: The generator for the finite field Z_11 should have an order of 10, which is a factor of the field's order (11-1 = 10). This means the correct answer should be a primitive root of 11 to generate all elements of the field.
Answer: A
------------------------
59. ------------------------
Reasoning: Every group of order 159 is not necessarily cyclic, as groups of prime order are always cyclic, but 159 is not prime. Therefore, Statement 1 is False. Every group of order 102 does have a nontrivial proper normal subgroup, making Statement 2 True.
Answer: C
------------------------
60. ------------------------
Reasoning: The first statement indicates that if either H or K is a normal subgroup of G, then HK is a subgroup of G. This is true because the product of two normal subgroups is also a subgroup. The second statement states that all groups of order p^2 where p is prime are Abelian, which is true because groups of prime order are always cyclic and therefore Abelian.
Answer: A
------------------------
61. ------------------------
Reasoning: The unity of a subring must be the same as the unity of the ring because the unity element in a ring is unique and must be preserved in any subring. Additionally, a field is a specific type of integral domain with additional properties, making both statements true.
Answer: A

Reasoning: The number of homomorphisms from Z to Z_2 is determined by the kernel of the homomorphism, which is a subgroup of Z. There are two relevant subgroups for this scenario: the trivial subgroup {0} and the whole group Z itself. Therefore, there are two homomorphisms from Z to Z_2.
Answer: B
------------------------
66. ------------------------
Reasoning: From the perspective of the definition of a field in mathematics and its relation to being a ring, a field is a specific type of ring that also has additional properties such as multiplicative inverses for all non-zero elements. Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is true.
Answer: A
------------------------
67. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because the degree of the sum of two polynomials in a ring is indeed equal to the maximum of the degrees of the individual polynomials. Statement 2 is false because not every ideal of a field is principal.

Answer: B
------------------------
72. ------------------------
Reasoning: The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)) over Q is equal to the product of the degrees of the intermediate field extensions, which are both 2. Therefore, the overall degree is 2 * 2 = 4.
Answer: B
------------------------
73. ------------------------
Reasoning: By applying Fermat's theorem, we can simplify the calculation of the remainder of 3^47 when divided by 23. Since 23 is a prime number and 3 is not divisible by 23, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem which states that a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 (mod p) for any prime number p and integer a not divisible by p. Therefore, we can find the remainder by calculating 3^(23-1) which is congruent to 1 (mod 23). This means that 3^47 is equivalent to 3^(23*2 + 1) which simplifies to 3^1, giving a remainder of 3 when divided by 23.
Answer: C
------------------------
74. ------------------------
Reasoning: The elements of the ring Z_3 x Z_3 are ordered pairs (a, b) where a, b are elements of Z_3, the ring of integers modulo 3. Addition in Z_3 x Z_3 is defined component-wise, resulting in closure under addition and commutativity. Multiplication is also defined element-wise. Z_3 x Z_3 inherits properties like commutativity, associativity, and distributivity from Z_3. 
Answer: A
------------------------
75. ------------------------
Reasoning: The first statement is true because in a group, if a and b are distinct elements, their squares will also be distinct due to the closure property of groups.

81. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because the external direct product of cyclic groups is indeed cyclic. Statement 2 is false because the external direct product of D_3 and D_4 is not isomorphic to D_12.
Answer: C
------------------------
82. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should be Statement 2, which states that every free abelian group of rank at least 2 has an infinite number of bases because the rank of a free abelian group directly influences the number of bases it can have. When the rank is at least 2, there are multiple linearly independent elements in the basis, allowing for a variety of bases to be formed, leading to an infinite number of bases.
Answer: D
------------------------
83. ------------------------
Reasoning: Every finite cyclic group contains an element of every order that divides the order of the group, which is a fundamental property of cyclic groups. This property is crucial in understanding the structure and elements of cyclic groups.
Answer: C
------------------------
84. ------------------------
Reasoning: The orders of elements in a group are independent of each other, so a group can have elements of specific orders without necessarily having elements of other orders.
Answer: C
------------------------
85. ------------------------
Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because for g to be injective, it must map distinct elements of B to distinct elements of A. Since g(f(a)) = a for all a in A, this implies that f(a) uniquely determines a in A. Therefore, g must be injective to ensure that distinct elements in B are mapped to distinct elements in A. On the other hand, Statement 2 is false because g does not necessarily have to be surjective. Surjectivity would require that every element in A has a pre-image in B under g, but this is not a requirement for the given relationship between g and f. It is possible for g to not cover all elements of A and still satisfy the condition g(f(a)) = a for all a in A.
Answer: C
------------------------
86. Reasoning: Statement 1 is true because a homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel consists of the identity element alone. Statement 2 is false because the image of a group of 6 elements under any homomorphism cannot have more elements than the original group.

Reasoning: Permutations are bijective functions that rearrange elements in a set, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between elements in the domain and codomain. While every permutation is a one-to-one function, not every one-to-one function is a permutation. Therefore, Statement 1 is true, and Statement 2 is false.
Answer: C

94. ------------------------
Reasoning: The maximum possible order for an element of S_6 is 6 because the order of an element in a symmetric group S_n is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles, and in this case, the maximum order is achieved when the element is a single 6-cycle.

Reasoning: The order of an element (4, 2) in Z_12 x Z_8 is the least common multiple of the orders of 4 in Z_12 (which is 3) and 2 in Z_8 (which is 4), so the order is lcm(3, 4) = 12.
Answer: C
------------------------
100. ------------------------
Reasoning: An ideal in a ring is a subset that is closed under addition with elements of the ring and absorbs elements of the ring, while a subring of a ring is a subset that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication, which is a stronger condition than being an ideal. Therefore, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false.
