Reasoning: The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns describes how as additional units of a variable input are added to a fixed input, the marginal output will eventually decrease because resources become less productive. This concept is crucial for optimizing production processes and resource allocation.
Answer: D
------------------------
43. ------------------------
Reasoning: The definition of economics typically revolves around the study of how scarce resources are allocated to satisfy unlimited wants, which is in line with the fundamental principles of economics.
Answer: D
------------------------
44. ------------------------
Reasoning: The law of diminishing returns states that as additional units of a variable input (in this case, labor) are added to fixed amounts of other inputs (capital), the marginal product of the variable input will eventually decrease. In this scenario, the increase in output from adding each successive unit of labor is getting smaller (50 units from 1st to 2nd unit, 25 units from 2nd to 3rd unit), indicating diminishing returns to labor.

180. ------------------------
Reasoning: The relationship between average product (AP) and marginal product (MP) of labor is such that when AP is greater than MP, AP is increasing. When AP is less than MP, AP is decreasing. This is because the average product of labor is calculated by dividing total output by the number of units of labor, while the marginal product of labor is the additional output produced by one more unit of labor. Therefore, if the average product is higher than the marginal product, it means that each additional unit of labor is contributing more than the average, leading to an increase in average product. Conversely, if the average product is lower than the marginal product, it means that each additional unit of labor is contributing less than the average, resulting in a decrease in average product.
