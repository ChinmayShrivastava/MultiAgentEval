Reasoning: Uranus and Neptune have a higher concentration of methane in their atmospheres compared to Jupiter and Saturn, leading to the formation of blue methane clouds. The unique temperature and pressure conditions on Uranus and Neptune allow for the creation of these methane clouds, which is not the case for Jupiter and Saturn.
Answer: A
------------------------
132. ------------------------
Reasoning: Option B states that most rocks on the Moon's surface are older than those on Earth's surface, which does not align with the Giant Impact Hypothesis as it does not provide evidence for a massive collision between Earth and a Mars-sized object leading to the creation of the moon.
Answer: B
------------------------
133. ------------------------
Reasoning: Geological evidence on Mars suggests the presence of dried-up river channels, lakebeds, and mineral deposits that can only form in the presence of water, indicating a warmer and wetter climate in the past.
Answer: C
------------------------
134. ------------------------
Reasoning: The most widely accepted explanations among astronomers for Jupiter's internal heat generation involve gravitational contraction or differentiation of materials within the planet, converting gravitational potential energy into heat. 
Answer: B
------------------------
135. ------------------------
Reasoning: Scorpius is a zodiac constellation and is visible in the summer sky, which means it is located along the Milky Way. Perseus, Cygnus, and Leo are not part of the zodiac constellations and are not typically visible in the summer sky, making them less likely to be located along the Milky Way.
Answer: C
------------------------
136. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct order of electromagnetic radiation categories from shortest to longest wavelength is gamma rays, X rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, and radio waves.
Answer: D
------------------------
137. ------------------------
Reasoning: Pluto's average distance from the Sun is about 39.5 astronomical units, resulting in an orbital period of approximately 248 Earth years.
Answer: C
------------------------
138. ------------------------
Reasoning: The atmosphere on Mars consists mostly of carbon dioxide, which lacks oxygen, making it impossible for humans to breathe on the surface without technological assistance.
Answer: D
------------------------
139. ------------------------
Reasoning: Jovian planets with rings are likely to have strong gravitational pulls and a system of moons, which contribute to the formation and maintenance of planetary rings.
Answer: D
------------------------
140. ------------------------
Reasoning: Neutrinos have the weakest interactions with other particles, making them less likely to collide or interact with surrounding particles due to their low mass and neutral charge.
Answer: C
------------------------
141. ------------------------
Reasoning: Based on crater counting, radiometric dating of rocks, and analysis of impact melt rocks commonly used in planetary geology to determine the age of planetary surfaces, the correct answer is D. 4.5 billion years.
Answer: D
------------------------
142. ------------------------
Reasoning: Jovian planets like Jupiter and Saturn bulge around the equator due to their rapid rotation causing centrifugal force, pushing mass outward. This is why they have a "squashed" appearance. 
Answer: C
------------------------
143. ------------------------
Reasoning: Based on radioactive decay of elements in its core, gravitational compression, and leftover heat from its formation, the most widely accepted explanations for Jupiter's internal heat generation.
Answer: B
------------------------
144. ------------------------
Reasoning: The habitable zone around a star is defined by the region where liquid water can potentially exist on planetary surfaces, making it a key factor in determining habitability.
Answer: A
------------------------
145. ------------------------
Reasoning: Cepheid stars are relevant for astronomers to measure galactic distances accurately due to their well-established relationship between luminosity and pulsation period, making them reliable standard candles for determining distances in the universe.
Answer: B
------------------------
146. ------------------------
Reasoning: Bolometric luminosity in astronomy is defined as a comprehensive measure of the total energy output of a star across all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. It takes into account all wavelengths of light emitted by the star, providing a more complete picture of its energy output compared to measurements at specific wavelengths.
Answer: D

Reasoning: Based on spectral analysis of sunlight, utilizing the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and considering the Sun's effective temperature, the best approximation for the surface temperature of the Sun is 6000 K.
Answer: A
------------------------
149. ------------------------
Reasoning: Based on the criteria used to determine proximity of stars to Earth in the context of the International Astronomical Art Competition (IAAC) and the method of measuring distances to stars using parallax, the second closest star(system) should be Wolf 359.
Answer: A
------------------------
150. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer, D, aligns with the perspective that planetary rings are formed from accretion within the solar nebula at the same time the planets formed. This explanation is consistent with the widely accepted theories regarding the formation of planetary rings based on gravitational interactions and debris from the solar system's early stages.
Answer: D
------------------------
151. ------------------------
Reasoning: The lunar maria are dark lavas filling older impact basins, formed by ancient volcanic activity on the Moon's surface.
Answer: C
