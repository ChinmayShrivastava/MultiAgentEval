364. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should contain contractionary policies that aim to decrease aggregate demand and reduce inflationary pressures in the economy. Among the options provided, option C includes decreasing the money supply, increasing taxes, and reducing government spending, which are all contractionary policies that can help close an inflationary gap.
Answer: C
------------------------
365. ------------------------
Reasoning: The appropriate fiscal and monetary policies during the contractionary phase of the business cycle should focus on targeted government spending, tax cuts, and increased transfer payments to stimulate economic growth. Therefore, the correct answer is not A or D. Lower discount rates would encourage borrowing and spending, while budget surpluses would indicate a reduction in government spending, which is not ideal during a contractionary phase. Hence, the correct answer is C. 
Answer: C
------------------------
366. ------------------------
Reasoning: Monetarist theory emphasizes the importance of controlling the money supply and believes that central banks should focus on managing inflation through controlling the money supply. Therefore, the correct answer is D, as Monetarists advocate for allowing the money supply to grow at a constant rate.
Answer: D

Reasoning: To close a recessionary gap, the focus should be on increasing aggregate demand to stimulate economic activity. This can be achieved by shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right through expansionary fiscal or monetary policies. 
Answer: A
------------------------
370. ------------------------
Reasoning: The equilibrium price of good A will increase, while the equilibrium quantity of good A will decrease because producers will reduce current supply in anticipation of higher future prices, leading to a decrease in equilibrium quantity and an increase in equilibrium price.
Answer: A
------------------------
371. ------------------------
Reasoning: An increase in exports due to a depreciation of the international value of the dollar would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.
Answer: B

Answer: A
------------------------
374. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer for this question would be D. Increasing money spent to pay for government projects. This option does not align with contractionary fiscal policy as it involves an increase in government spending, which goes against the objective of reducing aggregate demand and controlling inflation.
Answer: D
------------------------
375. ------------------------
Reasoning: Crowding out occurs when increased government spending leads to higher demand for borrowing, which drives up interest rates and discourages private investors from borrowing and investing, resulting in a decrease in private investment.
Answer: C
------------------------
376. ------------------------
Reasoning: Selling government securities reduces the reserves of banks, leading to a decrease in the money supply through the money multiplier effect.
Answer: B
------------------------

Reasoning: A cement mixer, a barrel of crude oil, and a registered nurse are not examples of capital as an economic resource. A share of corporate stock represents ownership in a company and is a financial asset, not a physical asset used in the production of goods or services. The correct example of capital as an economic resource is a cement mixer, which is a tangible asset used in the production process to increase productivity and efficiency.
Answer: A
------------------------
378. ------------------------
Reasoning: When considering the equation of exchange in economics, the correct answer is the one that defines the components accurately.

Answer: D
------------------------
379. ------------------------
Reasoning: An American entrepreneur founding and locating a software company in London does not directly impact aggregate demand in the United States. The closure of a military base in California may lead to a decrease in government spending and potential job losses, which could negatively impact aggregate demand. The Chinese government making it difficult for American firms to export goods to China would likely decrease exports and potentially harm aggregate demand. On the other hand, a Mexican entrepreneur founding and locating a software company in St. Louis could potentially increase job opportunities, consumer spending, and overall economic activity in the United States, thus boosting aggregate demand.
Answer: D
------------------------
380. ------------------------
Reasoning: Expansionary monetary policy during a recession aims to increase money supply, lower interest rates, and boost consumer spending to stimulate economic growth.
Answer: B
------------------------
