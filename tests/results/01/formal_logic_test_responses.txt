Reasoning: Indirect truth tables require a systematic analysis of the truth values of propositions to determine the validity of an argument. By constructing truth tables for each proposition and examining the logical relationships between them, we can determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premises.
Answer: B
------------------------
110. ------------------------
Reasoning: The truth table for ~(J ∨ K) · L and (L ⊃ J) · K should be constructed accurately to determine if they are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent. 
For ~(J ∨ K) · L, the truth value is dependent on the truth values of propositions J, K, and L. 
For (L ⊃ J) · K, the truth value should be true only when L implies J and K is true. 
By comparing the truth values of both statements in the truth tables, we can determine if they are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.
Answer: C. Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent

Reasoning: The correct translation into predicate logic should include a universal quantifier, a predicate symbol representing the action, variables representing the subjects, and implication to show the relationship between the subject and the action. The translation (∀x)(Sx ⊃ Fx) accurately represents the statement "All first-year students take a swim test."
Answer: A
------------------------
112. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct translation into predicate logic for "Johnny came late" should include predicates representing Johnny and the action of coming late, with a logical connective between them. The subject should be represented as an individual entity. 
Answer: A
------------------------
113. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct translation should include a universal quantifier, negation, implication, and specific predicates to accurately represent the original statement in predicate logic.
Answer: D

Reasoning: The conclusion of the argument is that the importance of DNA was not really understood until the 1950s, which is highlighted as the final key milestone in the development of genetics.
Answer: B
------------------------
115. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should accurately represent the conditional statements and necessary conditions in the sentence. Option A, (E ⊃ F) ∨ (C ≡ ~S), correctly symbolizes the necessary condition and conditional statements present in the sentence.
Answer: A
------------------------
116. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should accurately represent the relationships between sufficient and necessary conditions, clearly identify the countries and their actions, and properly connect the conditions with logical operators. Looking at the options, option A, (E ⊃ F) ∨ (S ⊃ C), accurately captures the relationships between the conditions and countries mentioned in the sentence.
Answer: A
------------------------
117. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should include negations for both "math" and "science" and use a logical operator that represents "neither/nor" to accurately symbolize Dylan's dislike for both subjects in propositional logic.
Answer: D
------------------------
118. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct translation should include a universal quantifier (∀) followed by the predicates representing robots and artifacts. The statement "All robots are artifacts" implies that every object classified as a robot is also classified as an artifact, which aligns with the use of the universal quantifier.
Answer: C
------------------------
119. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should accurately symbolize the causal relationship between the university raising tuition, the president's approval, and the board not preventing it using implication, conjunction, and negation. Option C (U ⊃ (P • ~B)) correctly represents this relationship.
Answer: C
------------------------
120. ------------------------
Reasoning: The conclusion that capital punishment should not be abolished is supported by the potential negative outcomes mentioned in the argument, such as overcrowded prisons and the need for more prison facilities.
Answer: A
------------------------
121. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct answer should accurately represent the conditional relationships, negations, necessary conditions, and biconditional statements present in the sentence. Option A includes the necessary condition symbolized by the implication (⊃), the negation (~), and the biconditional (≡) accurately, making it the best symbolization.
Answer: A
------------------------
122. ------------------------
Reasoning: To determine the validity of the argument using indirect truth tables, we need to systematically evaluate the truth values of each proposition and identify a row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. Looking at the options, option B provides a counterexample where L, M, and N are true, but K is false, making the conclusion false despite the premises being true. This counterexample demonstrates the invalidity of the argument.
Answer: B
------------------------
123. ------------------------
Reasoning: By constructing a complete truth table for the argument and evaluating the truth values of the premises and conclusion, it can be determined that the argument is invalid. The correct answer is B because a counterexample can be found when H and I are true, but G is false, which results in the premises being true while the conclusion is false.
Answer: B
------------------------
124. ------------------------
Reasoning: By constructing a truth table for the argument ~(M ≡ ~N) and evaluating the truth values of the premises and conclusion, we can determine the validity of the argument. If there is at least one row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid. Therefore, we need to look for a counterexample where M and N are true to show the argument is invalid.
Answer: B
------------------------
125. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct translation should include the existence of at least one CEO (∃x), the universal quantifier for everyone (∀y), and the comparison of wealth represented by the predicate Wxy.
Answer: A
------------------------
126. ------------------------
Reasoning: The correct translation should include the predicate Gxy, where x represents a child and y represents a school. This accurately captures the concept of children going to a school in the predicate logic translation. Additionally, the translation should utilize both universal and existential quantifiers to represent "All children go to some school."
Answer: A
