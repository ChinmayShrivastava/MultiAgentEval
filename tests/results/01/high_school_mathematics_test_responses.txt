Reasoning: To calculate the number of ants of Species A on Day 5, we need to determine the initial number of ants for both Species A and Species B on Day 0. Given that there are twice as many ants of Species A than before and three times as many ants of Species B, we can set up equations to find the initial number of ants for each species. Let x be the initial number of ants for Species A and y be the initial number of ants for Species B. From the information provided, we have the equations:
x = 2 * (x / 2) = 2x (twice as many ants of Species A than before)
y = 3 * (y / 3) = 3y (three times as many ants of Species B than before)
Given that on Day 0, there are 30 ants in total, we can set up the equation:
x + y = 30
Solving these equations simultaneously, we find x = 20 and y = 10. Therefore, the initial number of ants for Species A on Day 0 is 20. To find the number of ants of Species A on Day 5, we can calculate 20 * 2^5 = 20 * 32 = 640 ants of Species A.

Reasoning: The total amount owed at the end of 5 years under the first option should be half of the original loan amount plus the accrued interest for 5 years. The interest is compounded quarterly, leading to higher overall interest payments. The total amount to be paid back at the end of 10 years under the second option can be calculated using the simple interest formula. Option 1 allows for a reduction in the total amount owed after 5 years, potentially saving Alex money in the long run compared to option 2.
Answer: A

Reasoning: The expected number of times Bob will roll his die can be calculated by considering the probabilities of rolling a composite number, a prime number, and rolling a 1. The probability of rolling a composite number is 2/3, the probability of rolling a prime number is 2/3, and the probability of rolling a 1 is 1/6. Since Bob will have to roll again if he rolls a 1, the expected number of times he will roll his die is 6. Therefore, in a non-leap year with 365 days, Bob is expected to roll his die 365 times.
