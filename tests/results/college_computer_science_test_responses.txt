Reasoning: The cluster centers in k-Means Clustering are computed as the mean of all points in each cluster. Therefore, to find the cluster centers after the first iteration, we need to calculate the mean of the points in each cluster. 
Calculating the mean for each cluster:
C1: ((0+6)/2, (6+0)/2) = (3,3)
C2: ((2+4+6)/3, (2+4+6)/3) = (4,4)
C3: ((5+7)/2, (5+7)/2) = (6,6)
Therefore, the cluster centers computed for these 3 clusters are C1: (3,3), C2: (4,4), C3: (6,6).

Reasoning: In this hash table implementation, when a collision occurs, the linear resolution method is used to find the next available bucket. Since the hash function h(i) = i mod 5 is used, if bucket 2 is filled, the next buckets to be tried are 3, 4, 0, and 1 in that order. Therefore, after inserting elements with keys 13, 8, 24, 10, and 3 in that order, the content of bucket numbered 2 will be the element with key 3 as it is the first available bucket after bucket 2 is filled.

Reasoning: If A is context-free, then B is context-free because when B is a subset of A, it means that all elements in B are also in A. If A is context-free, it means that there exists a context-free grammar that generates the strings in A. Since B is a subset of A, the same context-free grammar that generates the strings in A can also generate the strings in B, making B context-free as well.

Reasoning: Currying is a process in functional programming where a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. The correct signature for the addition function in a curried form should be add : real -> (real -> real) because currying involves transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.
Answer: D
------------------------
49. ------------------------
Reasoning: The loop iterates over 256 elements of Array A and performs a read-modify-write operation on each element. Since the cache is direct-mapped with an 8-byte block size, each element access will result in a cache miss due to the interleaving of elements from Array A and B. As a result, each cache miss will trigger a write-back to memory. Therefore, a total of 256 cache misses will occur, resulting in 256 * 4 bytes = 1024 bytes being written to memory.

69. ------------------------
Reasoning: The processing power of each workstation is crucial in determining the total time required for the compilation. A workstation with higher processing power will be able to complete the computation task more quickly, thereby reducing the total time required for the compilation. This is because faster processing speeds will result in quicker execution of the 30 seconds of computation and 200 file page accesses. On the other hand, a workstation with lower processing power will take longer to complete the same tasks, resulting in a higher total time required for the compilation. Therefore, the ratio of the total time required by this compilation if run on the diskless (file server) workstation to the total time required if run on the workstation with the local disk will be influenced by the processing power of each workstation.

In this case, there are 18 '1's out of 32 bits. Dividing 18 by 32 and multiplying by 100 gives us 56.25%, which rounds to the nearest percent as 56%. Therefore, the percentage of occupied tracks for the corresponding part of the disk is 56%.
Answer: D

81. ------------------------
Reasoning: A complete graph with 12 vertices will have all vertices with even degree, making it possible to have an Euler circuit. A complete graph with 13 vertices will not have all vertices with even degree, making it impossible to have an Euler circuit. A tree with 13 vertices cannot have an Euler circuit due to the absence of cycles.
Answer: A

Reasoning: Ternary logic allows for the representation of three different states (true, false, unknown) for each logic element, meaning each flit can represent 3 values. To represent at least 256 different values, we need to find the smallest power of 3 that is greater than or equal to 256. 3^5 = 243 < 256, but 3^6 = 729 > 256. Therefore, 6 flits are required.

Reasoning: The complexity of finding the shortest simple path between two distinct vertices in a connected, undirected graph is generally lower than that of finding the longest simple path due to the nature of the algorithms used. Algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or the A* algorithm can efficiently find the shortest path by considering edge weights, while finding the longest simple path involves exploring all possible paths, which can be computationally expensive. 
Answer: C

Reasoning: The main disadvantage of direct mapping in cache organization is that the cache hit ratio is degraded if two or more blocks used alternately map onto the same block frame in the cache.
Answer: C
------------------------
95. ------------------------
Reasoning: The problem of determining whether the computation C lasts for at least n steps is decidable because the number of steps taken by the Turing machine can be counted and compared to the input n.
The problem of checking if M prints a 1 after the nth step is also decidable as it involves simulating the Turing machine to track the output.
However, the problem of M scanning at least n distinct tape squares during the computation C is not decidable as it involves an infinite number of possibilities.
Therefore, the correct answer is I and II only.

Reasoning: The correct formula to calculate availability is Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR). Given that the MTBF is 10,000 hours and the MTTR is 20 hours, plugging these values into the formula gives Availability = 10,000 / (10,000 + 20) = 10,000 / 10,020 ≈ 0.997. Converting this to a percentage gives 99.7%, which is closest to option D.
