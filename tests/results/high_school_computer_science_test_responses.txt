Answer: B
------------------------
47. ------------------------
Reasoning: The number of bits needed to represent a color in the RGB model is determined by the range of values for each color channel (red, green, blue) and the formula 2^n where n is the number of bits needed for each channel. Each channel can have values ranging from 0 to 255, which requires 8 bits (2^8 = 256) to represent all possible values. Therefore, a total of 24 bits (8 bits for red, 8 bits for green, and 8 bits for blue) are needed to represent a color in the RGB model.

67. ------------------------
Reasoning: Algorithm I sets the initial value of max to -1, ensuring that any value in the list will be greater than -1, guaranteeing that the first value encountered will be assigned to max. This guarantees that the maximum value will be correctly identified during iteration. On the other hand, Algorithm II starts with the first data value, which may or may not be the maximum value in the list, potentially leading to incorrect results if the maximum value is smaller than the first data value.
Answer: B
------------------------
68. ------------------------
Reasoning: The max(matrix[2]) call will return the largest integer in the row at index 2 of the matrix, which is 7. The max(matrix[3]) call will return the largest integer in the row at index 3 of the matrix, which is 4. Finally, the outer max method call will compare these two values and return the larger of the two, which is 7.
Answer: C

Reasoning: Dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics and will result in a runtime error, so the error will be detected during run time.
Answer: D
------------------------
95. ------------------------
Reasoning: Selection sort is known for its high number of data movements regardless of the initial arrangement of elements, making it inefficient in terms of minimizing data movements. On the other hand, insertion sort can be more efficient when the array is initially sorted in descending order because it requires fewer data movements in such cases. Therefore, the correct statement is that the number of data movements in selection sort depends on the initial arrangement of elements.
