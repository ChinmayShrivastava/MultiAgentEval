Reasoning: Statement I is true because if A and C are connected, then B must also be connected. This is because if A and C are connected, then any continuous function from A to C must pass through B. Therefore, B is also connected. This follows the transitive property of connectedness in topological spaces. Statement II is true because if A and C are compact, then B must also be compact. This is because in a topological space, a compact set is defined as a set for which every open cover has a finite subcover. Since A is a proper subset of B and B is a proper subset of C, if A and C are compact, then B must also be compact because any open cover of B can be refined to open covers of A and C, which have finite subcovers. Statement III is true because a subset of a Hausdorff space is also a Hausdorff space. Therefore, all statements I, II, and III are true.

Reasoning: The number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of an integer's factorial is determined by the number of pairs of 2's and 5's in the prime factorization of that integer. To have exactly 99 zeros at the end of k!, there must be at least 99 pairs of 2's and 5's in the prime factorization of k. Since the number of 5's will be less than the number of 2's, the limiting factor is the number of 5's. The number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of k will determine the number of zeros. The highest power of 5 that divides k! is given by the formula [k/5] + [k/25] + [k/125] + ... where [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. For exactly 99 zeros, the highest power of 5 should be 99. By calculating the highest power of 5 that divides k! for different values of k, it can be determined that there are 5 positive integers k for which k! ends in exactly 99 zeros.

This implies that John takes less than k days to complete a practice test. Therefore, the total time taken when Kate starts (10 days) is greater than when John starts (10.5 days) in the alternating 2-day shifts scenario. Since working simultaneously allows them to combine their efforts and work more efficiently together, the total time taken when working simultaneously should be less than 10 days. The correct answer is A. 9/2 days.

Reasoning: The equation of the tangent line to the graph of y = x + e^x at x = 0 should be in the form y = mx + b where m is the derivative of the function at x = 0 and b is the value of the function at x = 0. The derivative of y = x + e^x is 1 + e^x, so at x = 0, the derivative is 1 + e^0 = 1. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is y = 1*x + (0 + e^0) = x + 1.

Reasoning: In the standard topology on R^2, open sets are defined as unions of open balls. Since the set S consists of points with at least one irrational coordinate, it is not possible to find an open ball around any point in S that is completely contained within S. This means that S cannot be an open set in the standard topology on R^2. Similarly, since the complement of an open set is closed, and the set S is not open, it follows that S is not closed either. Furthermore, the set S is not connected because it can be partitioned into two disjoint open sets: one containing points with irrational x-coordinates and the other containing points with irrational y-coordinates. Therefore, S is neither open nor closed.

Reasoning: The circle that has the greatest number of points of intersection with the parabola x^2 = y + 4 will have its center on the axis of symmetry of the parabola, resulting in the maximum number of points of intersection.

Reasoning: The number of subsets containing exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets containing exactly 2 elements. By understanding this relationship, we can calculate the number of subsets containing exactly 4 elements.

Reasoning: The transformation T is uniquely determined by its action on a basis of the vector space. Since the points (1, 2) and (-1, 2) do not form a basis for R^2, we need to find a basis to determine how T maps the point (2, 1).
