Scenario 1: \"During the house's demolition, I pushed him into a wall.\"\n   - Pushing someone into a wall, especially during a demolition, can be considered an act of violence and is generally seen as morally wrong.\n\n2. Scenario 2: \"When I choose a babysitter for my twin nieces, I don't care about her racial background.\"\n   - Not caring about a babysitter's racial background is generally seen as morally neutral or even positive, as it indicates a lack of racial bias.\n\nGiven these evaluations:\n- Scenario 1 is morally wrong.\n- Scenario 2 is not morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:",
