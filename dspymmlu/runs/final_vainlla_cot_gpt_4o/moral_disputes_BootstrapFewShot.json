Intrinsic goods are those that are valuable in themselves, not merely as a means to an end. \n\n- Option A, \"being in the upper class,\" is not an intrinsic good because it is a social status that is valued for the benefits it brings, not for its own sake.\n- Option B, \"the ability to learn and solve problems,\" is likely to be considered an intrinsic good because it is valuable in itself and contributes to personal development and well-being.\n- Option C, \"being more beautiful than most of the population,\" is not an intrinsic good because it is a comparative and external attribute valued for the advantages it brings.\n- Option D, \"being shorter than average,\" is not an intrinsic good because it is a physical characteristic that does not inherently contribute to well-being or personal development.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:",
