        "rationale": "produce the answer. We need to consider how a mutation in an enzyme can affect its function. The enzyme's substrate specificity is largely determined by the shape and structure of the enzyme, which is influenced by the amino acids that make up the enzyme. Even a change in an amino acid distant from the active site can cause a change in the overall shape of the enzyme, potentially altering its substrate specificity. Therefore, the correct answer is:",
