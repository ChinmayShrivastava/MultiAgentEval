ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the immediate source of energy for muscle contractions.\n2. ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a product of ATP breakdown and is not the direct energy source.\n3. Phosphocreatine helps regenerate ATP but is not the direct energy source.\n4. Oxidative phosphorylation is a process that produces ATP but is not the direct energy source itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is ATP.",
