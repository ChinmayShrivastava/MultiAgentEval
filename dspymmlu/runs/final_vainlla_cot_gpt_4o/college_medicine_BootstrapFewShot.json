We need to identify which variables, when increased, will result in an increase in pressure according to the ideal gas law (PV = nRT). \n\n- Increasing temperature (T) will increase pressure (P) if volume (V) and moles of gas (n) are constant.\n- Increasing the moles of gas (n) will also increase pressure (P) if volume (V) and temperature (T) are constant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:",
