We need to consider the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy (\u0394U) of a system is equal to the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W). Mathematically, this is expressed as \u0394U = Q - W.\n\n- For a constant temperature process (isothermal), the internal energy of an ideal gas does not change (\u0394U = 0), so the heat added is equal to the work done by the gas (Q = W).\n- For a constant volume process (isochoric), no work is done by the gas (W = 0), so the change in internal energy is equal to the heat added (\u0394U = Q).\n- For a constant pressure process (isobaric), the work done by the gas is not zero, so the heat added is not equal to the change in internal energy (Q \u2260 \u0394U).\n- For an adiabatic process, no heat is added or removed (Q = 0), so the change in internal energy is equal to the negative of the work done by the gas (\u0394U = -W).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the process where the increase in internal energy is equal",
