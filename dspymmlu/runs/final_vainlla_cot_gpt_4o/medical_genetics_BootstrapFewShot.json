Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is typically used for amplifying small segments of DNA, but it may not be effective for very large repeat expansions.\n2. Single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is used to detect small changes in DNA sequence, not large expansions.\n3. Southern blotting is a technique that can detect large DNA fragments and is commonly used to identify large triplet repeat expansions.\n4. Western blotting is used to detect proteins, not DNA.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:",
