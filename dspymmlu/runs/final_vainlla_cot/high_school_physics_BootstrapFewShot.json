        "c": "12:00 AM",
        "d": "24 A",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We need to calculate the energy of the light using the formula E = hf, where h is Planck's constant. Then, we can calculate the number of photons hitting the metal plate per second using the power of the light. Finally, we can calculate the current through the resistor using the number of photons and the work function of the photocell.",

        "rationale": "produce the answer. We know that angular momentum is conserved when there is zero net external torque acting on the system. This means that option III must be true. Additionally, if there is zero net external force acting on the system, then linear momentum is conserved, which is not directly related to the conservation of angular momentum. Therefore, the correct answer is D.",

The potential difference can be calculated using the formula V = k * (Q \/ r), where k is the Coulomb constant, Q is the fixed charge, and r is the distance between the charges. Plugging in the values, we get V = (9 * 10^9 Nm^2\/C^2) * (1 * 10^-3 C \/ 5 m) = 1.8 * 10^6 V. Now, we can calculate the work done as W = (8 * 10^-6 C) * (1.8 * 10^6 V) = 14.4 J.",
