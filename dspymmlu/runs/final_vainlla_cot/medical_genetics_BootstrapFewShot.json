Among the options provided, the technique commonly used to detect such expansions is Southern blotting, which involves the detection of specific DNA sequences.",

Pyloric stenosis, schizophrenia, and spina bifida are all examples of conditions that have been shown to have multifactorial inheritance patterns.
