        "a": "Propionic acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation inhibits liver fatty acid synthesis",

        "d": "Butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation stimulates anti-oxidant defences in the colon",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We know that butyric acid, formed during colonic fibre fermentation, has been shown to have anti-cancer effects in the colon. This is because butyric acid can stimulate apoptosis (cell death) in cancer cells and inhibit their growth. Therefore, option D is the most plausible explanation for the protective effect of dietary fibre against colon cancer.",
