        "b": "Opposition of the thumb by opponens policis is supplied by spinal root T1",
        "c": "Finger adduction is supplied by the median nerve",
        "d": "Finger abduction is mediated by the palmar interossei",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We know that the opposition of the thumb is a key function in hand function and is primarily controlled by the opponens pollicis muscle. This muscle is innervated by the median nerve, which arises from spinal roots C8-T1. Therefore, the correct answer is B.",
