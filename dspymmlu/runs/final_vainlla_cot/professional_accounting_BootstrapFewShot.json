        "rationale": "produce the answer. The total expense should include the $15,000 maintenance agreement and the $5,000 software modification costs. Since the maintenance period begins on March 1, year 2, only 10 months of the maintenance agreement should be recognized in year 1. Therefore, the total expense recognized in year 1 should be $15,000 * (10\/12) + $5,000 = $13,500.",
