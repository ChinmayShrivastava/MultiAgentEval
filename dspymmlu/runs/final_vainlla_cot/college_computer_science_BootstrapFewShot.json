This means that the class should have a private constructor to prevent external instantiation. Additionally, the class should have a static factory method to provide access to the single instance. Finally, the Singleton class can be a subclass of another class. Therefore, all statements I, II, and III are true.",

Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?",
