        "rationale": "produce the answer. We first need to calculate the area of the coil, which is 40 mm * 30 mm = 1200 mm^2 = 0.0012 m^2. The torque is given by the product of the magnetic field, area of the coil, and the current. So, 240*10^-6 = 1 * 0.0012 * I. Solving for I, we get I = 0.2 A = 200 mA.",
