        "rationale": "produce the answer. The pleura are innervated by the intercostal nerves and the phrenic nerve, providing sensory innervation. The pleural cavity is a potential space that contains a small amount of pleural fluid to lubricate the pleural surfaces, not a 2 mm space. The pleura extend into the neck, known as the cervical pleura. The pleura are composed of simple squamous epithelium, not respiratory epithelium.",

The ophthalmic branch contains only sensory processes, while the maxillary and mandibular branches contain both sensory and motor processes. The supraorbital, infraorbital, and mental nerves are all branches of the maxillary division, which means they contain somatic motor processes.",
