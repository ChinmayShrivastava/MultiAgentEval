        "b": "They possess an open circulatory system with a dorsal heart.",

        "rationale": "produce the answer. Arthropods are known for their exoskeleton composed primarily of chitin, not peptidoglycan. They also have a dorsal heart and an open circulatory system. Therefore, option B is the correct statement.",

Therefore, q = \u221a(1\/400) = 1\/20. The frequency of carriers (2pq) can be calculated as 2 * (1\/20) * (19\/20) = 38\/400.",

This movement is driven by a pressure gradient created by the loading of sugars at the source and unloading at the sink. This pressure gradient is what drives the flow of photosynthate through the phloem.",
