Sulfates are soluble except for those of calcium, strontium, barium, silver, and lead. Therefore, option B is incorrect. Hydroxides are insoluble except for those of group 1 metals, ammonium, and calcium. Therefore, option C is incorrect. Ammonium-containing compounds are soluble. Therefore, option D is correct.",
