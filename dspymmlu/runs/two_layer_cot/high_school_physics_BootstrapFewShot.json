Which of the following is a correct statement about the wave\u2019s properties at the closed end of the pipe?\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to determine the wave\u2019s properties at the closed end of the pipe. We need to consider the nature of standing waves in pipes that are closed at one end. In such pipes, the closed end must be a node for displacement (where the air particles do not move) and an antinode for pressure (where the pressure variation is maximum). This is because the closed end cannot allow air particles to move, but it can support variations in pressure.",

At the closed end of the pipe, the air cannot move, so the particle displacement must be zero, which means it is at a node. However, the pressure variation is at its maximum at this point, which means the pressure is at an antinode.
