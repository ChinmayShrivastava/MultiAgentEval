The horizontal component is given by v\u2080x = v\u2080 * cos(\u03b8), and the vertical component is given by v\u2080y = v\u2080 * sin(\u03b8), where v\u2080 is the initial velocity and \u03b8 is the launch angle. Since air resistance is negligible, the only force acting on the ball in the horizontal direction is its initial velocity, so the horizontal velocity remains constant.

In the vertical direction, the only force acting on the ball is gravity, so we can use the vertical velocity to calculate the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height and then return to the ground. By adding the time it takes to reach the maximum height to the time it takes to return to the ground, we can find the total flight time of the soccer ball.", "correct": false}, "Two identical containers are filled with different gases.

First, we can find the horizontal distance the stone travels using the formula: distance = speed * time. So, distance = 30 m/s * 4 s = 120 m. Since the stone is thrown horizontally, the vertical speed at the point of impact will be the same as the initial vertical speed. Using the formula for vertical speed: final speed = initial speed + (acceleration due to gravity * time), we get: final speed = 0 m/s + (9.8 m/s^2 * 4 s) = 39.2 m/s. \n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the total speed when it enters the water. Total speed = \u221a(horizontal speed^2 + vertical speed^2) = \u221a(30 m/s)^2 + (39.2 m/s)^2 = \u221a(900 + 1536.64) = \u221a2436.64 = 49.36 m/s.", "correct": true}, "What happens to the force of gravitational attraction between two small objects if the mass of each object is doubled and the distance between their centers is doubled?": {"answer": "C", "rationale": "solve the question.
