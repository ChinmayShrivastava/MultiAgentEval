We can factor the expression as $(a+7)(a-1)$. To find the minimum value, we look for the vertex of the parabola, which occurs at $a = -\\frac{b}{2a} = -\\frac{6}{2} = -3$. Substituting $a = -3$ into the expression gives $(-3+7)(-3-1) = 4(-4) = -16$.","answer":"D"},true],["high_school_microeconomics","Which of the following is a correct statement?","Average total cost equals marginal cost plus average fixed costs.","Average total cost equals marginal costs plus average variable costs.","Average total cost equals average fixed costs plus average variable costs.","Total fixed costs vary with output.",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that average total cost is the sum of average fixed costs and average variable costs.

We know that sp^3 hybrid orbitals are formed by the combination of one s orbital and three p orbitals. This results in four degenerate orbitals with a tetrahedral geometry. Each hybrid orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons, totaling eight electrons for the entire set of orbitals. Therefore, the statement that each hybrid orbital may hold four electrons is NOT true.","answer":"D"},true],["miscellaneous","In storing printmaking supplies, it is important to store which of the following materials separately from the others?","Acetic acid","Rosin powder","Nitric acid","Solvents",{"rationale":"produce the answer. Acetic acid, nitric acid, and solvents are all highly reactive and should be stored separately. Rosin powder is not reactive and can be stored with other materials.

The COSO framework focuses on evaluating internal controls based on risk identification, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities. Evaluating internal control systems that focus first on risk identification of specific losses is a key aspect of the COSO framework.
