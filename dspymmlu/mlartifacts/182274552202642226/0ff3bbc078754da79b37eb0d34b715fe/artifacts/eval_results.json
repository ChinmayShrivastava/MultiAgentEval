The homeowner received notice that her uncle had passed away and left her a two-story mansion in a neighboring city. The homeowner decided to move her primary residence to the mansion and rent the ranch-style home. She entered into a one- year written lease agreement with a tenant. The agreement set the monthly rent at $1,000. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the home, he built, at his own expense, a room addition onto the home. The room addition increased the appraised market value of the home from $200,000 to $250,000. At the expiration of the lease, the homeowner informed the tenant that she had decided to sell the home. She offered the tenant the first opportunity to buy the home, but the tenant replied that he could not afford to do so. The tenant did claim that he should be entitled to compensation for the room addition, since it had increased the value of the home, and the homeowner agreed. The tenant and the homeowner then executed the following agreement:\"On the sale of the ranch-style home, the homeowner hereby promises to pay the tenant one- half of any sale proceeds in excess of $200,000, in compensation of the tenant's efforts in constructing the room addition onto the home. In addition, it is hereby agreed that the tenant may remain on the land until the sale is finalized, at a monthly rent of$500. ,'The homeowner initially set the asking price at $250,000, but received no offers to purchase the home. The homeowner decided to reduce the price to $210,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the home to all of the prospective buyers who visited the home. Two months later, the homeowner sold the home to a buyer for $206,000. The buyer had visited the home while the tenant was away on a business trip and therefore did not hear the tenant's negative comments.

Realizing that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the power to take a certain amount of property or of income is only another way of saying that for a certain proportion of his time a citizen must work for the government, the authority to impose a tax on the people has been most carefully guarded.\u2026 A government which lays taxes on the people not required by urgent necessity and sound public policy is not a protector of liberty, but an instrument of tyranny. It condemns the citizen to tyranny. One of the first signs of the breaking down of free government is a disregard by the taxing power of the right of the people to their own property.\u2026 Unless the people can enjoy that reasonable security in the possession of their property, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, against unreasonable taxation, freedom is at an end.\u2026 With us economy is imperative. It is a full test of our national character.\u2026 It is always the people who toil that pay.\n\u2014Calvin Coolidge, \"Economy in the Interest of All,\" June 30, 1924\nWhich of the following political ideas best reflects the perspective of Calvin Coolidge in the passage above?","Taxation is an effective means of redistributing wealth.","Government should be limited.","A bigger government can ensure social justice.","Government has the final say on what people do with their property.",{"rationale":"produce the answer. Calvin Coolidge emphasizes the importance of limited government and the protection of individual property rights. He warns against excessive taxation and views it as a threat to freedom. Therefore, the correct answer is:","answer":"B"},true],["high_school_computer_science","A large hospital maintains a list of patients\u2019 records in no particular order.

We are looking for the most efficient method to find a patient's record in a list of records. Option B, doing a binary search on the name field of the records, is the most efficient method as it has a time complexity of O(log n) compared to the other options which have a time complexity of O(n) or O(n log n).","answer":"B"},false],["high_school_chemistry","Based on periodic relationships, the bond strength, and the concept relating bond strength to acid strengths, which of the following correctly predicts the strength of binary acids from strongest to weakest?","H2Se > H2O > H2S","H2Se > H2S > H2O","H2O < H2S < H2Se","H2O > H2S > H2Se",{"rationale":"produce the answer. The strength of binary acids increases as the bond strength between the hydrogen and the other atom decreases. Going down a group in the periodic table, the bond strength decreases. Therefore, the correct order from strongest to weakest binary acids is H2Se > H2S > H2O.","answer":"B"},true],["machine_learning","In Yann LeCun's cake, the cherry on top is","reinforcement learning","self-supervised learning","unsupervised learning","supervised learning",{"rationale":"produce the answer. Yann LeCun is known for his work in supervised learning, particularly in the field of deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Therefore, the cherry on top of his cake would likely be supervised learning, as it is a fundamental aspect of his research and contributions to the field.","answer":"D"},false],["prehistory","Which structures housed religious ceremonies?","pit-houses","pueblos","kivas","courtyard groups",{"rationale":"produce the answer. Religious ceremonies were typically held in kivas, which were subterranean structures used by the Ancestral Puebloans for religious rituals and ceremonies.","answer":"C"},true],["international_law","What kind of State practice is required?","Widespread, consistent and uniform practice, consisting both of acts and omissions.","Only widespread, consistent and uniform acts and not omissions of States","Widespread acts and omissions of States but not necessarily consistent or uniform","Consistent practice of few States, including both acts and omissions, which is met with protestation by the other States",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that State practice required in international law must be widespread, consistent, and uniform, consisting of both acts and omissions.","answer":"A"},true],["high_school_biology","Which of the following does NOT take place in the small intestine?","Pancreatic lipase breaks down fats to fatty acids and glycerol.","Pepsin breaks down proteins to amino acids.","Pancreatic amylase breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars.","Bile emulsifies fats into smaller fat particles.",{"rationale":"produce the answer. We know that pepsin breaks down proteins in the stomach, not the small intestine. Pancreatic lipase, pancreatic amylase, and bile all play roles in digestion within the small intestine.","answer":"B"},true]]}
