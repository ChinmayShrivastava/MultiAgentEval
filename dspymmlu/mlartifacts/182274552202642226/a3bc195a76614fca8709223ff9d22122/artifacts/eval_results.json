Substituting the given values, Q = 2 mF * 5 V = 0.01 C.","produce the answer. The electric field produced by an infinitely long charged cylinder decreases as the inverse square of the distance for distances far from the cylinder. This is because the electric field lines spread out uniformly in all directions, leading to a decrease in field strength as the distance increases.","produce the answer. In this case, the electric field outside the object is directly proportional to the distance away from the center of mass of the object. This is because the charge distribution is not uniform, leading to a non-uniform electric field.","produce the answer. The speed of a wave on a string is given by v = \u221a(T\/\u03bc), where T is the tension in the string and \u03bc is the linear mass density of the string. Since the frequency of the generator remains constant, the speed of the wave will increase with increased tension. As the speed increases, the wavelength will also increase, so the new standing waves will have a greater wavelength.","produce the answer. When capacitors are connected in parallel, the voltage across each capacitor is the same, so option II must be true. The capacitance of the capacitors is identical since they are described as identical, so option III must also be true. However, the charge stored on each capacitor can be different, so option I is not necessarily true.","produce the answer. As the object slides down the incline, some of its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. However, due to the presence of friction on the rough surface, some of the mechanical energy is lost as thermal energy. Therefore, the object's kinetic energy at the bottom of the incline will be less than the block's gravitational potential energy when it was released.","produce the answer. When the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, the small block will experience the maximum acceleration and force due to the spring-block system. Therefore, the small block is most likely to slide off at this point. The condition for the small block not to slide off is when the frictional force between the blocks is greater than the maximum force that can cause sliding. This force is given by the normal force between the blocks multiplied by the coefficient of static friction. The normal force is (M+m)g, where M is the mass of the original block and m is the mass of the small block. The maximum force that can cause sliding is the force exerted by the spring-block system at maximum displacement, which is kA. Therefore, the condition for the small block not to slide off is when the coefficient of static friction is greater than kA\/[(M+m)g].","produce the answer. The energy stored in a capacitor is given by the formula E = 0.5 * C * V^2, where C is the capacitance and V is the potential difference. Substituting the given values, E = 0.5 * 10 \u00b5F * (100 V)^2 = 0.05 J.","produce the answer. The box will slide until it comes to rest, which means all its initial kinetic energy will be converted into work done against friction. The work done against friction is equal to the initial kinetic energy, which can be calculated using 0.5 * m * v0^2. The work done against friction is also equal to the force of friction times the distance traveled. The force of friction can be calculated using \u03bc * m * g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Equating the two expressions for work done against friction gives the distance traveled as v0^2\/(2\u03bcg).","produce the answer. We can break down the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components. Using the vertical component, we can calculate the time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height. Then, we can calculate the total flight time by doubling this time.","produce the answer. At thermal equilibrium, the gases will have the same temperature. Since the gases are at the same temperature, the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules is the same. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The force exerted by the gas molecules on the container is related to the pressure, not the type of gas. Density is related to the mass and volume of the gas, not the type of gas. The pressure of a gas is determined by the number of molecules and the temperature, so without knowing the number of molecules in each container, we cannot compare the pressures.","produce the answer. The see-saw is currently tilted in favor of the boy, so to balance it, we need to shift the center of mass towards the girl's side. Options A, B, and C all involve shifting the center of mass towards the girl's side, which would help balance the see-saw. However, moving the fulcrum towards the boy's side (option D) would not help balance the see-saw.","produce the answer. The primary reason for the phenomenon described is the transfer of energy between the water and alcohol molecules until their average kinetic energies are the same, leading to thermal equilibrium.","produce the answer. The torque applied to the sphere can be calculated using the formula \u03c4 = rFsin(\u03b8), where r is the distance from the axis of rotation, F is the force applied, and \u03b8 is the angle between the force and the lever arm. The torque causes an angular acceleration, which can be calculated using the formula \u03c4 = I\u03b1, where I is the moment of inertia and \u03b1 is the angular acceleration. Finally, the time taken for the sphere to come to rest can be calculated using the formula \u03c9 = \u03c90 + \u03b1t, where \u03c90 is the initial angular speed, \u03c9 is the final angular speed (0 in this case), and t is the time.","produce the answer. The gravitational field strength at the surface of a planet is given by g = GM\/r^2, where G is the universal gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the radius of the planet. Since the mass of Mars is one-tenth that of Earth and the radius of Mars is half that of Earth, the gravitational field strength on Mars would be approximately 0.5 N\/kg.","produce the answer. The electric field below the plane will be equal in magnitude to the electric field above the plane, but in the opposite direction. This is because the plane acts as a mirror for the electric field lines. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field below the plane is \u03c3\/2\u03b5o, and it points down.","produce the answer. The force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is given by the formula F = qvB, where q is the charge of the particle, v is its velocity, and B is the magnetic field strength. The centripetal force required to keep the electron in a circular path is provided by this magnetic force. Equating the two forces, we can solve for the radius of the circle.","produce the answer.
