Recall that the degree of a field extension is the dimension of the extension as a vector space over the base field. 2. Note that Q(sqrt(18)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) since sqrt(18) = sqrt(2) * sqrt(3). 3. Therefore, the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). 4. The degree of the extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) over Q is 4, as it is generated by the basis {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)}. 5. Thus, the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is also 4. 6. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 4.","1. Recall that the index of a subgroup H in a group G is given by |G| \/ |H|, where |G| is the order of the group G and |H| is the order of the subgroup H. 2. The order of the symmetric group S_5 is 5!, which is 120. 3. To find the order of the subgroup generated by p, we need to find the order of p. 4. Calculate the order of p by finding the least common multiple of the lengths of the disjoint cycles in the cycle decomposition of p. 5. The cycle decomposition of p is p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), which consists of two disjoint cycles of lengths 4 and 2. 6. The order of p is the least common multiple of 4 and 2, which is 4. 7. Therefore, the order of the subgroup generated by p is 4. 8. Finally,","1. Substitute each element of Z_5 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) into the polynomial x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x. 2. Calculate the value of the polynomial for each element of Z_5. 3. Check which elements of Z_5 make the polynomial equal to 0. These are the zeros of the polynomial in Z_5. 4. For x = 0, the polynomial becomes 0^5 + 3(0)^3 + 0^2 + 2(0) = 0. Therefore, x = 0 is a zero of the polynomial. 5. For x = 1, the polynomial becomes 1^5 + 3(1)^3 + 1^2 + 2(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 0. Therefore, x = 1 is a zero of the polynomial. 6. For x = 2","1. Statement 1 claims that a factor group of a non-Abelian group is non-Abelian. 2. Recall that a factor group is formed by taking a normal subgroup of a group and considering the cosets of that subgroup. 3. If the original group is non-Abelian, then the factor group will also be non-Abelian. Therefore, Statement 1 is True. 4. Statement 2 states that if K is a normal subgroup of H and H is a normal subgroup of G, then K is a normal subgroup of G. 5. By the transitivity of normality, if K is normal in H and H is normal in G, then K is normal in G. Therefore, Statement 2 is also True. 6. Therefore, the correct answer is A: True, True.","1.

Analyze Statement 1: If a group has an element of order 15, it must have at least 8 elements of order 15. 2. Consider a group with an element of order 15. This element generates a cyclic subgroup of order 15. 3. In a cyclic group, the number of elements of a given order is equal to the number of elements that divide that order. 4. Since 15 has factors 1, 3, 5, and 15, the cyclic subgroup of order 15 must have at least 4 elements of order 15. 5. Statement 1 is false because it claims that the group must have at least 8 elements of order 15, which is not necessarily true. 6. Analyze Statement 2: If a group has more than 8 elements of order 15, it must have at least 16 elements of order 15. 7. Consider a group with more than 8 elements of order 15. 8.

Recall that a factor group of a group G is a group obtained by taking a normal subgroup of G and forming the cosets of that subgroup. 3. Evaluate Statement 1: Every homomorphic image of a group G is isomorphic to a factor group of G. If this statement is true, then every homomorphic image of G should be isomorphic to a factor group of G. 4. Evaluate Statement 2: The homomorphic images of a group G are the same (up to isomorphism) as the factor groups of G. If this statement is true, then the homomorphic images of G should be equivalent (up to isomorphism) to the factor groups of G. 5. Determine if both statements are true, both are false, or if one is true and the other is false. 6. Select the corresponding answer choice based on the evaluation of the two statements.","1. Start by evaluating Statement 1: A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}. 2. If the kernel of a ring homomorphism is {0}, it means the homomorphism is injective (one-to-one). Therefore, Statement 1 is True. 3. Move on to Statement 2: Q is an ideal in R. 4. To determine if Q is an ideal in R, we need to check if it satisfies the properties of an ideal: closure under addition and multiplication by elements of R. 5. If Q is an ideal, it must also be the kernel of a ring homomorphism. 6. Since Statement 1 states that the kernel must be {0} for the homomorphism to be one-to-one, Statement 2 is False. 7. Analyze the relationship between the two statements: A ring homomorphism with a kernel of {0} is one-to-one, and the kernel is an ideal in the ring. 8. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: True, False.","1. Recall that the degree of a field extension is the dimension of the extension as a vector space over the base field. 2. Consider the field extension Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q. 3. Note that Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) contains elements of the form a + b(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)), where a and b are rational numbers. 4. Express any element in Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) as a linear combination of 1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(6) over Q. 5. Check if the set {1, sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(6)} is linearly independent over Q. 6. If the set is linearly independent, then the degree of the field extension is 4. If not, continue to find the minimal set of linearly independent elements that span Q(sqrt(2) + sqrt(3)) over Q.","1.

Similarly, a right coset of H in G is of the form Ha = {ha : h \u2208 H} for the same fixed element a. 3. For Statement 1, if |aH| = |Ha| for all a in G, then the left and right cosets are of the same size. 4. Check if Statement 1 holds true by considering a specific example or counterexample. 5. For Statement 2, if aH and Hb are identical, it means that aH = Hb, and if they are disjoint, it means that aH \u2229 Hb = \u2205. 6. Verify the validity of Statement 2 by considering different cases and examples. 7. Based on the definitions and properties of left and right cosets, determine whether each statement is true or false.","1. Recall the definitions of different types of relations: symmetric, anti-symmetric, and equivalence relation. 2. Check if the relation S is symmetric by verifying if for every (a, b) in S, (b, a) is also in S. 3. Since S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}, we see that (1, 1) is in S but (1, 1) is not in S. Therefore, S is not symmetric. 4. Check if the relation S is anti-symmetric by verifying if for every (a, b) in S, (b, a) is not in S whenever a \u2260 b. 5. Since S = {(1, 1), (2, 2)}, we see that (1, 1) and (2, 2) are in S, and (2, 1) is not in S. Therefore, S is anti-symmetric. 6. Since S is anti-symmetric but not symmetric, it cannot be both symmetric and anti-symmetric.","1. Recall that the order of a factor group G\/H is given by |G|\/|H|, where |G| is the order of the group G and |H| is the order of the subgroup H. 2. Calculate the order of the group Z_11 x Z_15. Since Z_11 and Z_15 are cyclic groups of order 11 and 15 respectively, the order of Z_11 x Z_15 is 11 * 15 = 165. 3. Calculate the order of the subgroup generated by (1, 1). Since (1, 1) generates a cyclic subgroup, the order of <1, 1> is the smallest positive integer n such that n(1, 1) = (0, 0). In this case, n = lcm(11, 15) = 165. 4. Substitute the values into the formula |G|\/|H| to find the order of the factor group: 165\/165 = 1. 5. Therefore,","1. Check if the polynomial x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 has any roots in Z_7. 2. Substitute each element of Z_7 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) into the polynomial and check if it equals 0. 3. Start with x = 0, we get 1 which is not 0. Move on to x = 1, we get 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 which is not 0. 4. Continue this process until you find a root. 5. For x = 2, we get 8 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 21 = 0 in Z_7. Therefore, x = 2 is a root of the polynomial. 6. Use polynomial division or synthetic division to divide x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 by (x - 2) to find the","1. Recall that the order of an element in a group is the smallest positive integer k such that g^k = e, where g is the element and e is the identity element. 2. In the symmetric group S_n, the order of an element is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the cycle lengths of its disjoint cycle decomposition. 3. For n = 10, the maximum possible order of an element in S_10 is the maximum possible LCM of cycle lengths. 4. The maximum possible LCM occurs when the element consists of disjoint cycles of lengths that are pairwise coprime. 5. The maximum possible order is the product of the largest possible cycle lengths that sum up to n. 6. The largest possible cycle lengths that sum up to 10 are 3, 3, 2, and 2. 7. Calculate the LCM of 3, 3, 2, and 2, which is 6. Therefore, the maximum possible order of an element in S_10 is 6.","1. Understand that Statement 1 is about the concept of a splitting field, while Statement 2 is about the existence of a field with a specific number of elements. 2. Recall that a splitting field is a field extension of a field F over which a polynomial splits into linear factors. 3. Consider that the existence of a field with 60 elements is related to the concept of finite fields. 4. Think about whether the existence of a field with 60 elements implies the existence of a polynomial with R as its splitting field over Q. 5. Recognize that the two statements are independent of each other. 6. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: False, False.","1. Recall that the inverse of an element a in a group G is the element b such that a * b = b * a = 1, where 1 is the identity element in G. 2. In this case, we are looking for the element b such that -i * b = b * (-i) = 1. 3. Since -i * -i = 1, we can see that the inverse of -i is -i itself. 4. Therefore, the inverse of -i in the multiplicative group {1, -1, i, -i} is -i.","1. To find the product of two elements in a direct product ring, multiply the corresponding components separately. 2. For the first component, multiply 2 * 3 = 6 in Z_5. Since 6 is congruent to 1 modulo 5, the first component of the product is 1. 3. For the second component, multiply 3 * 5 = 15 in Z_9. Since 15 is congruent to 6 modulo 9, the second component of the product is 6. 4. Therefore, the product of (2,3) and (3,5) in Z_5 x Z_9 is (1,6). 5. The correct answer is (C) (1,6).","1. Recall the four group axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and inverse element. 2. Check each option against the group axioms to determine which property is lacking in the set of all real numbers under usual multiplication. 3. Option A states that multiplication is not a binary operation, which is incorrect as multiplication is a binary operation on real numbers. 4. Option B states that multiplication is not associative, which is also incorrect as multiplication is associative on real numbers. 5. Option C states that an identity element does not exist, which is the correct property lacking in the set of all real numbers under usual multiplication. 6. Option D states that zero has no inverse, which is also incorrect as zero does not have a multiplicative inverse, but it is not necessary for forming a group. 7.
